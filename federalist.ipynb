       " [\"federalist no. \", \"after an unequivocal experience of the inefficacy of the subsisting federal government, you are called upon to deliberate on a new constitution for the united states of america. the subject speaks its own importance; comprehending in its consequences nothing less than the existence of the union, the safety and welfare of the parts of which it is composed, the fate of an empire in many respects the most interesting in the world. it has been frequently remarked that it seems to have been reserved to the people of this country, by their conduct and example, to decide the important question, whether societies of men are really capable or not of establishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend for their political constitutions on accident and force. if there be any truth in the remark, the crisis at which we are arrived may with propriety be regarded as the era in which that decision is to be made; and a wrong election of the part we shall act may, in this view, deserve to be considered as the general misfortune of mankind.\", \"this idea will add the inducements of philanthropy to those of patriotism, to heighten the solicitude which all considerate and good men must feel for the event. happy will it be if our choice should be directed by a judicious estimate of our true interests, unperplexed and unbiased by considerations not connected with the public good. but this is a thing more ardently to be wished than seriously to be expected. the plan offered to our deliberations affects too many particular interests, innovates upon too many local institutions, not to involve in its discussion a variety of objects foreign to its merits, and of views, passions and prejudices little favorable to the discovery of truth.\", \"among the most formidable of the obstacles which the new constitution will have to encounter may readily be distinguished the obvious interest of a certain class of men in every state to resist all changes which may hazard a diminution of the power, emolument, and consequence of the offices they hold under the state establishments; and the perverted ambition of another class of men, who will either hope to aggrandize themselves by the confusions of their country, or will flatter themselves with fairer prospects of elevation from the subdivision of the empire into several partial confederacies than from its union under one government.\", \"it is not, however, my design to dwell upon observations of this nature. i am well aware that it would be disingenuous to resolve indiscriminately the opposition of any set of men (merely because their situations might subject them to suspicion) into interested or ambitious views. candor will oblige us to admit that even such men may be actuated by upright intentions; and it cannot be doubted that much of the opposition which has made its appearance, or may hereafter make its appearance, will spring from sources, blameless at least, if not respectable--the honest errors of minds led astray by preconceived jealousies and fears. so numerous indeed and so powerful are the causes which serve to give a false bias to the judgment, that we, upon many occasions, see wise and good men on the wrong as well as on the right side of questions of the first magnitude to society. this circumstance, if duly attended to, would furnish a lesson of moderation to those who are ever so much persuaded of their being in the right in any controversy. and a further reason for caution, in this respect, might be drawn from the reflection that we are not always sure that those who advocate the truth are influenced by purer principles than their antagonists. ambition, avarice, personal animosity, party opposition, and many other motives not more laudable than these, are apt to operate as well upon those who support as those who oppose the right side of a question. were there not even these inducements to moderation, nothing could be more ill-judged than that intolerant spirit which has, at all times, characterized political parties. for in politics, as in religion, it is equally absurd to aim at making proselytes by fire and sword. heresies in either can rarely be cured by persecution.\", \"and yet, however just these sentiments will be allowed to be, we have already sufficient indications that it will happen in this as in all former cases of great national discussion. a torrent of angry and malignant passions will be let loose. to judge from the conduct of the opposite parties, we shall be led to conclude that they will mutually hope to evince the justness of their opinions, and to increase the number of their converts by the loudness of their declamations and the bitterness of their invectives. an enlightened zeal for the energy and efficiency of government will be stigmatized as the offspring of a temper fond of despotic power and hostile to the principles of liberty. an over-scrupulous jealousy of danger to the rights of the people, which is more commonly the fault of the head than of the heart, will be represented as mere pretense and artifice, the stale bait for popularity at the expense of the public good. it will be forgotten, on the one hand, that jealousy is the usual concomitant of love, and that the noble enthusiasm of liberty is apt to be infected with a spirit of narrow and illiberal distrust. on the other hand, it will be equally forgotten that the vigor of government is essential to the security of liberty; that, in the contemplation of a sound and well-informed judgment, their interest can never be separated; and that a dangerous ambition more often lurks behind the specious mask of zeal for the rights of the people than under the forbidden appearance of zeal for the firmness and efficiency of government. history will teach us that the former has been found a much more certain road to the introduction of despotism than the latter, and that of those men who have overturned the liberties of republics, the greatest number have begun their career by paying an obsequious court to the people; commencing demagogues, and ending tyrants.\", \"in the course of the preceding observations, i have had an eye, my fellow-citizens, to putting you upon your guard against all attempts, from whatever quarter, to influence your decision in a matter of the utmost moment to your welfare, by any impressions other than those which may result from the evidence of truth. you will, no doubt, at the same time, have collected from the general scope of them, that they proceed from a source not unfriendly to the new constitution. yes, my countrymen, i own to you that, after having given it an attentive consideration, i am clearly of opinion it is your interest to adopt it. i am convinced that this is the safest course for your liberty, your dignity, and your happiness. i affect not reserves which i do not feel. i will not amuse you with an appearance of deliberation when i have decided. i frankly acknowledge to you my convictions, and i will freely lay before you the reasons on which they are founded. the consciousness of good intentions disdains ambiguity. i shall not, however, multiply professions on this head. my motives must remain in the depository of my own breast. my arguments will be open to all, and may be judged of by all. they shall at least be offered in a spirit which will not disgrace the cause of truth.\", \"i propose, in a series of papers, to discuss the following interesting particulars:\", \"the utility of the union to your political prosperity the insufficiency of the present confederation to preserve that union the necessity of a government at least equally energetic with the one proposed, to the attainment of this object the conformity of the proposed constitution to the true principles of republican government its analogy to your own state constitution and lastly, the additional security which its adoption will afford to the preservation of that species of government, to liberty, and to property.\", \"in the progress of this discussion i shall endeavor to give a satisfactory answer to all the objections which shall have made their appearance, that may seem to have any claim to your attention.\", \"it may perhaps be thought superfluous to offer arguments to prove the utility of the union, a point, no doubt, deeply engraved on the hearts of the great body of the people in every state, and one, which it may be imagined, has no adversaries. but the fact is, that we already hear it whispered in the private circles of those who oppose the new constitution, that the thirteen states are of too great extent for any general system, and that we must of necessity resort to separate confederacies of distinct portions of the whole. this doctrine will, in all probability, be gradually propagated, till it has votaries enough to countenance an open avowal of it. for nothing can be more evident, to those who are able to take an enlarged view of the subject, than the alternative of an adoption of the new constitution or a dismemberment of the union. it will therefore be of use to begin by examining the advantages of that union, the certain evils, and the probable dangers, to which every state will be exposed from its dissolution. this shall accordingly constitute the subject of my next address.\", \"publius\"]\n",
       " [\"federalist no. \", \"when the people of america reflect that they are now called upon to decide a question, which, in its consequences, must prove one of the most important that ever engaged their attention, the propriety of their taking a very comprehensive, as well as a very serious, view of it, will be evident.\", \"nothing is more certain than the indispensable necessity of government, and it is equally undeniable, that whenever and however it is instituted, the people must cede to it some of their natural rights in order to vest it with requisite powers. it is well worthy of consideration therefore, whether it would conduce more to the interest of the people of america that they should, to all general purposes, be one nation, under one federal government, or that they should divide themselves into separate confederacies, and give to the head of each the same kind of powers which they are advised to place in one national government.\", \"it has until lately been a received and uncontradicted opinion that the prosperity of the people of america depended on their continuing firmly united, and the wishes, prayers, and efforts of our best and wisest citizens have been constantly directed to that object. but politicians now appear, who insist that this opinion is erroneous, and that instead of looking for safety and happiness in union, we ought to seek it in a division of the states into distinct confederacies or sovereignties. however extraordinary this new doctrine may appear, it nevertheless has its advocates; and certain characters who were much opposed to it formerly, are at present of the number. whatever may be the arguments or inducements which have wrought this change in the sentiments and declarations of these gentlemen, it certainly would not be wise in the people at large to adopt these new political tenets without being fully convinced that they are founded in truth and sound policy.\", \"it has often given me pleasure to observe that independent america was not composed of detached and distant territories, but that one connected, fertile, wide-spreading country was the portion of our western sons of liberty. providence has in a particular manner blessed it with a variety of soils and productions, and watered it with innumerable streams, for the delight and accommodation of its inhabitants. a succession of navigable waters forms a kind of chain round its borders, as if to bind it together; while the most noble rivers in the world, running at convenient distances, present them with highways for the easy communication of friendly aids, and the mutual transportation and exchange of their various commodities.\", \"with equal pleasure i have as often taken notice that providence has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united people--a people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language, professing the same religion, attached to the same principles of government, very similar in their manners and customs, and who, by their joint counsels, arms, and efforts, fighting side by side throughout a long and bloody war, have nobly established general liberty and independence.\", \"this country and this people seem to have been made for each other, and it appears as if it was the design of providence, that an inheritance so proper and convenient for a band of brethren, united to each other by the strongest ties, should never be split into a number of unsocial, jealous, and alien sovereignties.\", \"similar sentiments have hitherto prevailed among all orders and denominations of men among us. to all general purposes we have uniformly been one people each individual citizen everywhere enjoying the same national rights, privileges, and protection. as a nation we have made peace and war; as a nation we have vanquished our common enemies; as a nation we have formed alliances, and made treaties, and entered into various compacts and conventions with foreign states.\", \"a strong sense of the value and blessings of union induced the people, at a very early period, to institute a federal government to preserve and perpetuate it. they formed it almost as soon as they had a political existence; nay, at a time when their habitations were in flames, when many of their citizens were bleeding, and when the progress of hostility and desolation left little room for those calm and mature inquiries and reflections which must ever precede the formation of a wise and well-balanced government for a free people. it is not to be wondered at, that a government instituted in times so inauspicious, should on experiment be found greatly deficient and inadequate to the purpose it was intended to answer.\", \"this intelligent people perceived and regretted these defects. still continuing no less attached to union than enamored of liberty, they observed the danger which immediately threatened the former and more remotely the latter; and being persuaded that ample security for both could only be found in a national government more wisely framed, they as with one voice, convened the late convention at philadelphia, to take that important subject under consideration.\", \"this convention composed of men who possessed the confidence of the people, and many of whom had become highly distinguished by their patriotism, virtue and wisdom, in times which tried the minds and hearts of men, undertook the arduous task. in the mild season of peace, with minds unoccupied by other subjects, they passed many months in cool, uninterrupted, and daily consultation; and finally, without having been awed by power, or influenced by any passions except love for their country, they presented and recommended to the people the plan produced by their joint and very unanimous councils.\", \"admit, for so is the fact, that this plan is only recommended, not imposed, yet let it be remembered that it is neither recommended to blind approbation, nor to blind reprobation; but to that sedate and candid consideration which the magnitude and importance of the subject demand, and which it certainly ought to receive. but this (as was remarked in the foregoing number of this paper) is more to be wished than expected, that it may be so considered and examined. experience on a former occasion teaches us not to be too sanguine in such hopes. it is not yet forgotten that well-grounded apprehensions of imminent danger induced the people of america to form the memorable congress of . that body recommended certain measures to their constituents, and the event proved their wisdom; yet it is fresh in our memories how soon the press began to teem with pamphlets and weekly papers against those very measures. not only many of the officers of government, who obeyed the dictates of personal interest, but others, from a mistaken estimate of consequences, or the undue influence of former attachments, or whose ambition aimed at objects which did not correspond with the public good, were indefatigable in their efforts to persuade the people to reject the advice of that patriotic congress. many, indeed, were deceived and deluded, but the great majority of the people reasoned and decided judiciously; and happy they are in reflecting that they did so.\", \"they considered that the congress was composed of many wise and experienced men. that, being convened from different parts of the country, they brought with them and communicated to each other a variety of useful information. that, in the course of the time they passed together in inquiring into and discussing the true interests of their country, they must have acquired very accurate knowledge on that head. that they were individually interested in the public liberty and prosperity, and therefore that it was not less their inclination than their duty to recommend only such measures as, after the most mature deliberation, they really thought prudent and advisable.\", \"these and similar considerations then induced the people to rely greatly on the judgment and integrity of the congress; and they took their advice, notwithstanding the various arts and endeavors used to deter them from it. but if the people at large had reason to confide in the men of that congress, few of whom had been fully tried or generally known, still greater reason have they now to respect the judgment and advice of the convention, for it is well known that some of the most distinguished members of that congress, who have been since tried and justly approved for patriotism and abilities, and who have grown old in acquiring political information, were also members of this convention, and carried into it their accumulated knowledge and experience.\", \"it is worthy of remark that not only the first, but every succeeding congress, as well as the late convention, have invariably joined with the people in thinking that the prosperity of america depended on its union. to preserve and perpetuate it was the great object of the people in forming that convention, and it is also the great object of the plan which the convention has advised them to adopt. with what propriety, therefore, or for what good purposes, are attempts at this particular period made by some men to depreciate the importance of the union? or why is it suggested that three or four confederacies would be better than one? i am persuaded in my own mind that the people have always thought right on this subject, and that their universal and uniform attachment to the cause of the union rests on great and weighty reasons, which i shall endeavor to develop and explain in some ensuing papers. they who promote the idea of substituting a number of distinct confederacies in the room of the plan of the convention, seem clearly to foresee that the rejection of it would put the continuance of the union in the utmost jeopardy. that certainly would be the case, and i sincerely wish that it may be as clearly foreseen by every good citizen, that whenever the dissolution of the union arrives, america will have reason to exclaim, in the words of the poet: \\\"farewell! a long farewell to all my greatness.\\\"\", \"publius\"]\n",
       " [\"federalist no. \", \"it is not a new observation that the people of any country (if, like the americans, intelligent and wellinformed) seldom adopt and steadily persevere for many years in an erroneous opinion respecting their interests. that consideration naturally tends to create great respect for the high opinion which the people of america have so long and uniformly entertained of the importance of their continuing firmly united under one federal government, vested with sufficient powers for all general and national purposes.\", \"the more attentively i consider and investigate the reasons which appear to have given birth to this opinion, the more i become convinced that they are cogent and conclusive.\", \"among the many objects to which a wise and free people find it necessary to direct their attention, that of providing for their safety seems to be the first. the safety of the people doubtless has relation to a great variety of circumstances and considerations, and consequently affords great latitude to those who wish to define it precisely and comprehensively.\", \"at present i mean only to consider it as it respects security for the preservation of peace and tranquillity, as well as against dangers from foreign arms and influence, as from dangers of the like kind arising from domestic causes. as the former of these comes first in order, it is proper it should be the first discussed. let us therefore proceed to examine whether the people are not right in their opinion that a cordial union, under an efficient national government, affords them the best security that can be devised against hostilities from abroad.\", \"the number of wars which have happened or will happen in the world will always be found to be in proportion to the number and weight of the causes, whether real or pretended, which provoke or invite them. if this remark be just, it becomes useful to inquire whether so many just causes of war are likely to be given by united america as by disunited america; for if it should turn out that united america will probably give the fewest, then it will follow that in this respect the union tends most to preserve the people in a state of peace with other nations.\", \"the just causes of war, for the most part, arise either from violation of treaties or from direct violence. america has already formed treaties with no less than six foreign nations, and all of them, except prussia, are maritime, and therefore able to annoy and injure us. she has also extensive commerce with portugal, spain, and britain, and, with respect to the two latter, has, in addition, the circumstance of neighborhood to attend to.\", \"it is of high importance to the peace of america that she observe the laws of nations towards all these powers, and to me it appears evident that this will be more perfectly and punctually done by one national government than it could be either by thirteen separate states or by three or four distinct confederacies.\", \"because when once an efficient national government is established, the best men in the country will not only consent to serve, but also will generally be appointed to manage it; for, although town or country, or other contracted influence, may place men in state assemblies, or senates, or courts of justice, or executive departments, yet more general and extensive reputation for talents and other qualifications will be necessary to recommend men to offices under the national government,--especially as it will have the widest field for choice, and never experience that want of proper persons which is not uncommon in some of the states. hence, it will result that the administration, the political counsels, and the judicial decisions of the national government will be more wise, systematical, and judicious than those of individual states, and consequently more satisfactory with respect to other nations, as well as more safe with respect to us.\", \"because, under the national government, treaties and articles of treaties, as well as the laws of nations, will always be expounded in one sense and executed in the same manner,--whereas, adjudications on the same points and questions, in thirteen states, or in three or four confederacies, will not always accord or be consistent; and that, as well from the variety of independent courts and judges appointed by different and independent governments, as from the different local laws and interests which may affect and influence them. the wisdom of the convention, in committing such questions to the jurisdiction and judgment of courts appointed by and responsible only to one national government, cannot be too much commended.\", \"because the prospect of present loss or advantage may often tempt the governing party in one or two states to swerve from good faith and justice; but those temptations, not reaching the other states, and consequently having little or no influence on the national government, the temptation will be fruitless, and good faith and justice be preserved. the case of the treaty of peace with britain adds great weight to this reasoning.\", \"because, even if the governing party in a state should be disposed to resist such temptations, yet as such temptations may, and commonly do, result from circumstances peculiar to the state, and may affect a great number of the inhabitants, the governing party may not always be able, if willing, to prevent the injustice meditated, or to punish the aggressors. but the national government, not being affected by those local circumstances, will neither be induced to commit the wrong themselves, nor want power or inclination to prevent or punish its commission by others.\", \"so far, therefore, as either designed or accidental violations of treaties and the laws of nations afford just causes of war, they are less to be apprehended under one general government than under several lesser ones, and in that respect the former most favors the safety of the people.\", \"as to those just causes of war which proceed from direct and unlawful violence, it appears equally clear to me that one good national government affords vastly more security against dangers of that sort than can be derived from any other quarter.\", \"because such violences are more frequently caused by the passions and interests of a part than of the whole; of one or two states than of the union. not a single indian war has yet been occasioned by aggressions of the present federal government, feeble as it is; but there are several instances of indian hostilities having been provoked by the improper conduct of individual states, who, either unable or unwilling to restrain or punish offenses, have given occasion to the slaughter of many innocent inhabitants.\", \"the neighborhood of spanish and british territories, bordering on some states and not on others, naturally confines the causes of quarrel more immediately to the borderers. the bordering states, if any, will be those who, under the impulse of sudden irritation, and a quick sense of apparent interest or injury, will be most likely, by direct violence, to excite war with these nations; and nothing can so effectually obviate that danger as a national government, whose wisdom and prudence will not be diminished by the passions which actuate the parties immediately interested.\", \"but not only fewer just causes of war will be given by the national government, but it will also be more in their power to accommodate and settle them amicably. they will be more temperate and cool, and in that respect, as well as in others, will be more in capacity to act advisedly than the offending state. the pride of states, as well as of men, naturally disposes them to justify all their actions, and opposes their acknowledging, correcting, or repairing their errors and offenses. the national government, in such cases, will not be affected by this pride, but will proceed with moderation and candor to consider and decide on the means most proper to extricate them from the difficulties which threaten them.\", \"besides, it is well known that acknowledgments, explanations, and compensations are often accepted as satisfactory from a strong united nation, which would be rejected as unsatisfactory if offered by a state or confederacy of little consideration or power.\", \"in the year , the state of genoa having offended louis, endeavored to appease him. he demanded that they should send their doge, or chief magistrate, accompanied by four of their senators, to france, to ask his pardon and receive his terms. they were obliged to submit to it for the sake of peace. would he on any occasion either have demanded or have received the like humiliation from spain, or britain, or any other powerful nation?\", \"publius\"]\n",
       " [\"federalist no. \", \"my last paper assigned several reasons why the safety of the people would be best secured by union against the danger it may be exposed to by just causes of war given to other nations; and those reasons show that such causes would not only be more rarely given, but would also be more easily accommodated, by a national government than either by the state governments or the proposed little confederacies.\", \"but the safety of the people of america against dangers from foreign force depends not only on their forbearing to give just causes of war to other nations, but also on their placing and continuing themselves in such a situation as not to invite hostility or insult; for it need not be observed that there are pretended as well as just causes of war.\", \"it is too true, however disgraceful it may be to human nature, that nations in general will make war whenever they have a prospect of getting anything by it; nay, absolute monarchs will often make war when their nations are to get nothing by it, but for the purposes and objects merely personal, such as thirst for military glory, revenge for personal affronts, ambition, or private compacts to aggrandize or support their particular families or partisans. these and a variety of other motives, which affect only the mind of the sovereign, often lead him to engage in wars not sanctified by justice or the voice and interests of his people. but, independent of these inducements to war, which are more prevalent in absolute monarchies, but which well deserve our attention, there are others which affect nations as often as kings; and some of them will on examination be found to grow out of our relative situation and circumstances.\", \"with france and with britain we are rivals in the fisheries, and can supply their markets cheaper than they can themselves, notwithstanding any efforts to prevent it by bounties on their own or duties on foreign fish.\", \"with them and with most other european nations we are rivals in navigation and the carrying trade;

especially as to all that part of the western territory which, either by actual possession, or through the submission of the indian proprietors, was subjected to the jurisdiction of the king of great britain, till it was relinquished in the treaty of peace. this, it has been said, was at all events an acquisition to the confederacy by compact with a foreign power. it has been the prudent policy of congress to appease this controversy, by prevailing upon the states to make cessions to the united states for the benefit of the whole. this has been so far accomplished as, under a continuation of the union, to afford a decided prospect of an amicable termination of the dispute. a dismemberment of the confederacy, however, would revive this dispute, and would create others on the same subject. at present, a large part of the vacant western territory is, by cession at least, if not by any anterior right, the common property of the union. if that were at an end, the states which made the cession, on a principle of federal compromise, would be apt when the motive of the grant had ceased, to reclaim the lands as a reversion. the other states would no doubt insist on a proportion, by right of representation. their argument would be, that a grant, once made, could not be revoked; and that the justice of participating in territory acquired or secured by the joint efforts of the confederacy, remained undiminished. if, contrary to probability, it should be admitted by all the states, that each had a right to a share of this common stock, there would still be a difficulty to be surmounted, as to a proper rule of apportionment. different principles would be set up by different states for this purpose;

nor did she appear to be entirely resigned to it, till, by negotiation and management, something like an equivalent was found for the loss she supposed herself to have sustained. nothing here said is intended to convey the slightest censure on the conduct of that state. she no doubt sincerely believed herself to have been injured by the decision; and states, like individuals, acquiesce with great reluctance in determinations to their disadvantage.\", \"those who had an opportunity of seeing the inside of the transactions which attended the progress of the controversy between this state and the district of vermont, can vouch the opposition we experienced, as well from states not interested as from those which were interested in the claim; and can attest the danger to which the peace of the confederacy might have been exposed, had this state attempted to assert its rights by force. two motives preponderated in that opposition: one, a jealousy entertained of our future power; and the other, the interest of certain individuals of influence in the neighboring states, who had obtained grants of lands under the actual government of that district. even the states which brought forward claims, in contradiction to ours, seemed more solicitous to dismember this state, than to establish their own pretensions. these were new hampshire, massachusetts, and connecticut. new jersey and rhode island, upon all occasions, discovered a warm zeal for the independence of vermont; and maryland, till alarmed by the appearance of a connection between canada and that state, entered deeply into the same views. these being small states, saw with an unfriendly eye the perspective of our growing greatness. in a review of these transactions we may trace some of the causes which would be likely to embroil the states with each other, if it should be their unpropitious destiny to become disunited.\", \"the competitions of commerce would be another fruitful source of contention. the states less favorably circumstanced would be desirous of escaping from the disadvantages of local situation, and of sharing in the advantages of their more fortunate neighbors. each state, or separate confederacy, would pursue a system of commercial policy peculiar to itself. this would occasion distinctions, preferences, and exclusions, which would beget discontent. the habits of intercourse, on the basis of equal privileges, to which we have been accustomed since the earliest settlement of the country, would give a keener edge to those causes of discontent than they would naturally have independent of this circumstance. we should be ready to denominate injuries those things which were in reality the justifiable acts of independent sovereignties consulting a distinct interest. the spirit of enterprise, which characterizes the commercial part of america, has left no occasion of displaying itself unimproved. it is not at all probable that this unbridled spirit would pay much respect to those regulations of trade by which particular states might endeavor to secure exclusive benefits to their own citizens. the infractions of these regulations, on one side, the efforts to prevent and repel them, on the other, would naturally lead to outrages, and these to reprisals and wars.\", \"the opportunities which some states would have of rendering others tributary to them by commercial regulations would be impatiently submitted to by the tributary states. the relative situation of new york, connecticut, and new jersey would afford an example of this kind. new york, from the necessities of revenue, must lay duties on her importations. a great part of these duties must be paid by the inhabitants of the two other states in the capacity of consumers of what we import. new york would neither be willing nor able to forego this advantage. her citizens would not consent that a duty paid by them should be remitted in favor of the citizens of her neighbors; nor would it be practicable, if there were not this impediment in the way, to distinguish the customers in our own markets. would connecticut and new jersey long submit to be taxed by new york for her exclusive benefit? should we be long permitted to remain in the quiet and undisturbed enjoyment of a metropolis, from the possession of which we derived an advantage so odious to our neighbors, and, in their opinion, so oppressive? should we be able to preserve it against the incumbent weight of connecticut on the one side, and the co-operating pressure of new jersey on the other? these are questions that temerity alone will answer in the affirmative.\", \"the public debt of the union would be a further cause of collision between the separate states or confederacies. the apportionment, in the first instance, and the progressive extinguishment afterward, would be alike productive of ill-humor and animosity. how would it be possible to agree upon a rule of apportionment satisfactory to all? there is scarcely any that can be proposed which is entirely free from real objections. these, as usual, would be exaggerated by the adverse interest of the parties. there are even dissimilar views among the states as to the general principle of discharging the public debt. some of them, either less impressed with the importance of national credit, or because their citizens have little, if any, immediate interest in the question, feel an indifference, if not a repugnance, to the payment of the domestic debt at any rate. these would be inclined to magnify the difficulties of a distribution. others of them, a numerous body of whose citizens are creditors to the public beyond proportion of the state in the total amount of the national debt, would be strenuous for some equitable and effective provision. the procrastinations of the former would excite the resentments of the latter. the settlement of a rule would, in the meantime, be postponed by real differences of opinion and affected delays. the citizens of the states interested would clamour; foreign powers would urge for the satisfaction of their just demands, and the peace of the states would be hazarded to the double contingency of external invasion and internal contention.\", \"suppose the difficulties of agreeing upon a rule surmounted, and the apportionment made. still there is great room to suppose that the rule agreed upon would, upon experiment, be found to bear harder upon some states than upon others. those which were sufferers by it would naturally seek for a mitigation of the burden. the others would as naturally be disinclined to a revision, which was likely to end in an increase of their own incumbrances. their refusal would be too plausible a pretext to the complaining states to withhold their contributions, not to be embraced with avidity; and the non-compliance of these states with their engagements would be a ground of bitter discussion and altercation. if even the rule adopted should in practice justify the equality of its principle, still delinquencies in payments on the part of some of the states would result from a diversity of other causes--the real deficiency of resources; the mismanagement of their finances; accidental disorders in the management of the government; and, in addition to the rest, the reluctance with which men commonly part with money for purposes that have outlived the exigencies which produced them, and interfere with the supply of immediate wants. delinquencies, from whatever causes, would be productive of complaints, recriminations, and quarrels. there is, perhaps, nothing more likely to disturb the tranquillity of nations than their being bound to mutual contributions for any common object that does not yield an equal and coincident benefit. for it is an observation, as true as it is trite, that there is nothing men differ so readily about as the payment of money.\", \"laws in violation of private contracts, as they amount to aggressions on the rights of those states whose citizens are injured by them, may be considered as another probable source of hostility. we are not authorized to expect that a more liberal or more equitable spirit would preside over the legislations of the individual states hereafter, if unrestrained by any additional checks, than we have heretofore seen in too many instances disgracing their several codes. we have observed the disposition to retaliation excited in connecticut in consequence of the enormities perpetrated by the legislature of rhode island; and we reasonably infer that, in similar cases, under other circumstances, a war, not of parchment, but of the sword, would chastise such atrocious breaches of moral obligation and social justice.\", \"the probability of incompatible alliances between the different states or confederacies and different foreign nations, and the effects of this situation upon the peace of the whole, have been sufficiently unfolded in some preceding papers. from the view they have exhibited of this part of the subject, this conclusion is to be drawn, that america, if not connected at all, or only by the feeble tie of a simple league, offensive and defensive, would, by the operation of such jarring alliances, be gradually entangled in all the pernicious labyrinths of european politics and wars; and by the destructive contentions of the parts into which she was divided, would be likely to become a prey to the artifices and machinations of powers equally the enemies of them all. divide et impera must be the motto of every nation that either hates or fears us.\", \"publius\"]\n",
       " [\"federalist no. \", \"assuming it therefore as an established truth that the several states, in case of disunion, or such combinations of them as might happen to be formed out of the wreck of the general confederacy, would be subject to those vicissitudes of peace and war, of friendship and enmity, with each other, which have fallen to the lot of all neighboring nations not united under one government, let us enter into a concise detail of some of the consequences that would attend such a situation.\", \"war between the states, in the first period of their separate existence, would be accompanied with much greater distresses than it commonly is in those countries where regular military establishments have long obtained. the disciplined armies always kept on foot on the continent of europe, though they bear a malignant aspect to liberty and economy, have, notwithstanding, been productive of the signal advantage of rendering sudden conquests impracticable, and of preventing that rapid desolation which used to mark the progress of war prior to their introduction. the art of fortification has contributed to the same ends. the nations of europe are encircled with chains of fortified places, which mutually obstruct invasion. campaigns are wasted in reducing two or three frontier garrisons, to gain admittance into an enemy's country. similar impediments occur at every step, to exhaust the strength and delay the progress of an invader. formerly, an invading army would penetrate into the heart of a neighboring country almost as soon as intelligence of its approach could be received; but now a comparatively small force of disciplined troops, acting on the defensive, with the aid of posts, is able to impede, and finally to frustrate, the enterprises of one much more considerable. the history of war, in that quarter of the globe, is no longer a history of nations subdued and empires overturned, but of towns taken and retaken; of battles that decide nothing; of retreats more beneficial than victories; of much effort and little acquisition.\", \"in this country the scene would be altogether reversed. the jealousy of military establishments would postpone them as long as possible. the want of fortifications, leaving the frontiers of one state open to another, would facilitate inroads. the populous states would, with little difficulty, overrun their less populous neighbors. conquests would be as easy to be made as difficult to be retained. war, therefore, would be desultory and predatory. plunder and devastation ever march in the train of irregulars. the calamities of individuals would make the principal figure in the events which would characterize our military exploits.\", \"this picture is not too highly wrought; though, i confess, it would not long remain a just one. safety from external danger is the most powerful director of national conduct. even the ardent love of liberty will, after a time, give way to its dictates. the violent destruction of life and property incident to war, the continual effort and alarm attendant on a state of continual danger, will compel nations the most attached to liberty to resort for repose and security to institutions which have a tendency to destroy their civil and political rights. to be more safe, they at length become willing to run the risk of being less free.\", \"the institutions chiefly alluded to are standing armies and the correspondent appendages of military establishments. standing armies, it is said, are not provided against in the new constitution; and it is therefore inferred that they may exist under it. their existence, however, from the very terms of the proposition, is, at most, problematical and uncertain. but standing armies, it may be replied, must inevitably result from a dissolution of the confederacy. frequent war and constant apprehension, which require a state of as constant preparation, will infallibly produce them. the weaker states or confederacies would first have recourse to them, to put themselves upon an equality with their more potent neighbors. they would endeavor to supply the inferiority of population and resources by a more regular and effective system of defense, by disciplined troops, and by fortifications. they would, at the same time, be necessitated to strengthen the executive arm of government, in doing which their constitutions would acquire a progressive direction toward monarchy. it is of the nature of war to increase the executive at the expense of the legislative authority.\", \"the expedients which have been mentioned would soon give the states or confederacies that made use of them a superiority over their neighbors. small states, or states of less natural strength, under vigorous governments, and with the assistance of disciplined armies, have often triumphed over large states, or states of greater natural strength, which have been destitute of these advantages. neither the pride nor the safety of the more important states or confederacies would permit them long to submit to this mortifying and adventitious superiority. they would quickly resort to means similar to those by which it had been effected, to reinstate themselves in their lost pre-eminence. thus, we should, in a little time, see established in every part of this country the same engines of despotism which have been the scourge of the old world. this, at least, would be the natural course of things; and our reasonings will be the more likely to be just, in proportion as they are accommodated to this standard.\", \"these are not vague inferences drawn from supposed or speculative defects in a constitution, the whole power of which is lodged in the hands of a people, or their representatives and delegates, but they are solid conclusions, drawn from the natural and necessary progress of human affairs.\", \"it may, perhaps, be asked, by way of objection to this, why did not standing armies spring up out of the contentions which so often distracted the ancient republics of greece? different answers, equally satisfactory, may be given to this question. the industrious habits of the people of the present day, absorbed in the pursuits of gain, and devoted to the improvements of agriculture and commerce, are incompatible with the condition of a nation of soldiers, which was the true condition of the people of those republics. the means of revenue, which have been so greatly multiplied by the increase of gold and silver and of the arts of industry, and the science of finance, which is the offspring of modern times, concurring with the habits of nations, have produced an entire revolution in the system of war, and have rendered disciplined armies, distinct from the body of the citizens, the inseparable companions of frequent hostility.\", \"there is a wide difference, also, between military establishments in a country seldom exposed by its situation to internal invasions, and in one which is often subject to them, and always apprehensive of them. the rulers of the former can have no good pretext, if they are even so inclined, to keep on foot armies so numerous as must of necessity be maintained in the latter. these armies being, in the first case, rarely, if at all, called into activity for interior defense, the people are in no danger of being broken to military subordination. the laws are not accustomed to relaxations, in favor of military exigencies; the civil state remains in full vigor, neither corrupted, nor confounded with the principles or propensities of the other state. the smallness of the army renders the natural strength of the community an overmatch for it; and the citizens, not habituated to look up to the military power for protection, or to submit to its oppressions, neither love nor fear the soldiery; they view them with a spirit of jealous acquiescence in a necessary evil, and stand ready to resist a power which they suppose may be exerted to the prejudice of their rights.\", \"the army under such circumstances may usefully aid the magistrate to suppress a small faction, or an occasional mob, or insurrection; but it will be unable to enforce encroachments against the united efforts of the great body of the people.\", \"in a country in the predicament last described, the contrary of all this happens. the perpetual menacings of danger oblige the government to be always prepared to repel it; its armies must be numerous enough for instant defense. the continual necessity for their services enhances the importance of the soldier, and proportionably degrades the condition of the citizen. the military state becomes elevated above the civil. the inhabitants of territories, often the theatre of war, are unavoidably subjected to frequent infringements on their rights, which serve to weaken their sense of those rights; and by degrees the people are brought to consider the soldiery not only as their protectors, but as their superiors. the transition from this disposition to that of considering them masters, is neither remote nor difficult; but it is very difficult to prevail upon a people under such impressions, to make a bold or effectual resistance to usurpations supported by the military power.\", \"the kingdom of great britain falls within the first description. an insular situation, and a powerful marine, guarding it in a great measure against the possibility of foreign invasion, supersede the necessity of a numerous army within the kingdom. a sufficient force to make head against a sudden descent, till the militia could have time to rally and embody, is all that has been deemed requisite. no motive of national policy has demanded, nor would public opinion have tolerated, a larger number of troops upon its domestic establishment. there has been, for a long time past, little room for the operation of the other causes, which have been enumerated as the consequences of internal war. this peculiar felicity of situation has, in a great degree, contributed to preserve the liberty which that country to this day enjoys, in spite of the prevalent venality and corruption. if, on the contrary, britain had been situated on the continent, and had been compelled, as she would have been, by that situation, to make her military establishments at home coextensive with those of the other great powers of europe, she, like them, would in all probability be, at this day, a victim to the absolute power of a single man. it is possible, though not easy, that the people of that island may be enslaved from other causes; but it cannot be by the prowess of an army so inconsiderable as that which has been usually kept up within the kingdom.\", \"if we are wise enough to preserve the union we may for ages enjoy an advantage similar to that of an insulated situation. europe is at a great distance from us. her colonies in our vicinity will be likely to continue too much disproportioned in strength to be able to give us any dangerous annoyance. extensive military establishments cannot, in this position, be necessary to our security. but if we should be disunited, and the integral parts should either remain separated, or, which is most probable, should be thrown together into two or three confederacies, we should be, in a short course of time, in the predicament of the continental powers of europe--our liberties would be a prey to the means of defending ourselves against the ambition and jealousy of each other.\", \"this is an idea not superficial or futile, but solid and weighty. it deserves the most serious and mature consideration of every prudent and honest man of whatever party. if such men will make a firm and solemn pause, and meditate dispassionately on the importance of this interesting idea; if they will contemplate it in all its attitudes, and trace it to all its consequences, they will not hesitate to part with trivial objections to a constitution, the rejection of which would in all probability put a final period to the union. the airy phantoms that flit before the distempered imaginations of some of its adversaries would quickly give place to the more substantial forms of dangers, real, certain, and formidable.\", \"publius\"]\n",
       " [\"federalist no. \", \"a firm union will be of the utmost moment to the peace and liberty of the states, as a barrier against domestic faction and insurrection. it is impossible to read the history of the petty republics of greece and italy without feeling sensations of horror and disgust at the distractions with which they were continually agitated, and at the rapid succession of revolutions by which they were kept in a state of perpetual vibration between the extremes of tyranny and anarchy. if they exhibit occasional calms, these only serve as short-lived contrast to the furious storms that are to succeed. if now and then intervals of felicity open to view, we behold them with a mixture of regret, arising from the reflection that the pleasing scenes before us are soon to be overwhelmed by the tempestuous waves of sedition and party rage. if momentary rays of glory break forth from the gloom, while they dazzle us with a transient and fleeting brilliancy, they at the same time admonish us to lament that the vices of government should pervert the direction and tarnish the lustre of those bright talents and exalted endowments for which the favored soils that produced them have been so justly celebrated.\", \"from the disorders that disfigure the annals of those republics the advocates of despotism have drawn arguments, not only against the forms of republican government, but against the very principles of civil liberty. they have decried all free government as inconsistent with the order of society, and have indulged themselves in malicious exultation over its friends and partisans. happily for mankind, stupendous fabrics reared on the basis of liberty, which have flourished for ages, have, in a few glorious instances, refuted their gloomy sophisms. and, i trust, america will be the broad and solid foundation of other edifices, not less magnificent, which will be equally permanent monuments of their errors.\", \"but it is not to be denied that the portraits they have sketched of republican government were too just copies of the originals from which they were taken. if it had been found impracticable to have devised models of a more perfect structure, the enlightened friends to liberty would have been obliged to abandon the cause of that species of government as indefensible. the science of politics, however, like most other sciences, has received great improvement. the efficacy of various principles is now well understood, which were either not known at all, or imperfectly known to the ancients. the regular distribution of power into distinct departments; the introduction of legislative balances and checks; the institution of courts composed of judges holding their offices during good behavior; the representation of the people in the legislature by deputies of their own election: these are wholly new discoveries, or have made their principal progress towards perfection in modern times. they are means, and powerful means, by which the excellences of republican government may be retained and its imperfections lessened or avoided. to this catalogue of circumstances that tend to the amelioration of popular systems of civil government, i shall venture, however novel it may appear to some, to add one more, on a principle which has been made the foundation of an objection to the new constitution; i mean the enlargement of the orbit within which such systems are to revolve, either in respect to the dimensions of a single state or to the consolidation of several smaller states into one great confederacy. the latter is that which immediately concerns the object under consideration. it will, however, be of use to examine the principle in its application to a single state, which shall be attended to in another place.\", \"the utility of a confederacy, as well to suppress faction and to guard the internal tranquillity of states, as to increase their external force and security, is in reality not a new idea. it has been practiced upon in different countries and ages, and has received the sanction of the most approved writers on the subject of politics. the opponents of the plan proposed have, with great assiduity, cited and circulated the observations of montesquieu on the necessity of a contracted territory for a republican government. but they seem not to have been apprised of the sentiments of that great man expressed in another part of his work, nor to have adverted to the consequences of the principle to which they subscribe with such ready acquiescence.\", \"when montesquieu recommends a small extent for republics, the standards he had in view were of dimensions far short of the limits of almost every one of these states. neither virginia, massachusetts, pennsylvania, new york, north carolina, nor georgia can by any means be compared with the models from which he reasoned and to which the terms of his description apply. if we therefore take his ideas on this point as the criterion of truth, we shall be driven to the alternative either of taking refuge at once in the arms of monarchy, or of splitting ourselves into an infinity of little, jealous, clashing, tumultuous commonwealths, the wretched nurseries of unceasing discord, and the miserable objects of universal pity or contempt. some of the writers who have come forward on the other side of the question seem to have been aware of the dilemma; and have even been bold enough to hint at the division of the larger states as a desirable thing. such an infatuated policy, such a desperate expedient, might, by the multiplication of petty offices, answer the views of men who possess not qualifications to extend their influence beyond the narrow circles of personal intrigue, but it could never promote the greatness or happiness of the people of america.\", \"referring the examination of the principle itself to another place, as has been already mentioned, it will be sufficient to remark here that, in the sense of the author who has been most emphatically quoted upon the occasion, it would only dictate a reduction of the size of the more considerable members of the union, but would not militate against their being all comprehended in one confederate government. and this is the true question, in the discussion of which we are at present interested.\", \"so far are the suggestions of montesquieu from standing in opposition to a general union of the states, that he explicitly treats of a confederate republic as the expedient for extending the sphere of popular government, and reconciling the advantages of monarchy with those of republicanism.\", \"\\\"it is very probable,\\\" (says he) \\\"that mankind would have been obliged at length to live constantly under the government of a single person, had they not contrived a kind of constitution that has all the internal advantages of a republican, together with the external force of a monarchical government. i mean a confederate republic.\\\"\", \"\\\"this form of government is a convention by which several smaller states agree to become members of a larger one, which they intend to form. it is a kind of assemblage of societies that constitute a new one, capable of increasing, by means of new associations, till they arrive to such a degree of power as to be able to provide for the security of the united body.\\\"\", \"\\\"a republic of this kind, able to withstand an external force, may support itself without any internal corruptions. the form of this society prevents all manner of inconveniences.\\\"\", \"\\\"if a single member should attempt to usurp the supreme authority, he could not be supposed to have an equal authority and credit in all the confederate states. were he to have too great influence over one, this would alarm the rest. were he to subdue a part, that which would still remain free might oppose him with forces independent of those which he had usurped and overpower him before he could be settled in his usurpation.\\\"\", \"\\\"should a popular insurrection happen in one of the confederate states the others are able to quell it. should abuses creep into one part, they are reformed by those that remain sound. the state may be destroyed on one side, and not on the other; the confederacy may be dissolved, and the confederates preserve their sovereignty.\\\"\", \"\\\"as this government is composed of small republics, it enjoys the internal happiness of each; and with respect to its external situation, it is possessed, by means of the association, of all the advantages of large monarchies.\\\"\", \"i have thought it proper to quote at length these interesting passages, because they contain a luminous abridgment of the principal arguments in favor of the union, and must effectually remove the false impressions which a misapplication of other parts of the work was calculated to make. they have, at the same time, an intimate connection with the more immediate design of this paper; which is, to illustrate the tendency of the union to repress domestic faction and insurrection.\", \"a distinction, more subtle than accurate, has been raised between a confederacy and a consolidation of the states. the essential characteristic of the first is said to be, the restriction of its authority to the members in their collective capacities, without reaching to the individuals of whom they are composed. it is contended that the national council ought to have no concern with any object of internal administration. an exact equality of suffrage between the members has also been insisted upon as a leading feature of a confederate government. these positions are, in the main, arbitrary; they are supported neither by principle nor precedent. it has indeed happened, that governments of this kind have generally operated in the manner which the distinction taken notice of, supposes to be inherent in their nature; but there have been in most of them extensive exceptions to the practice, which serve to prove, as far as example will go, that there is no absolute rule on the subject. and it will be clearly shown in the course of this investigation that as far as the principle contended for has prevailed, it has been the cause of incurable disorder and imbecility in the government.\", \"the definition of a confederate republic seems simply to be \\\"an assemblage of societies,\\\" or an association of two or more states into one state. the extent, modifications, and objects of the federal authority are mere matters of discretion. so long as the separate organization of the members be not abolished; so long as it exists, by a constitutional necessity, for local purposes; though it should be in perfect subordination to the general authority of the union, it would still be, in fact and in theory, an association of states, or a confederacy. the proposed constitution, so far from implying an abolition of the state governments, makes them constituent parts of the national sovereignty, by allowing them a direct representation in the senate, and leaves in their possession certain exclusive and very important portions of sovereign power. this fully corresponds, in every rational import of the terms, with the idea of a federal government.\", \"in the lycian confederacy, which consisted of twenty-three cities or republics, the largest were entitled to three votes in the common council, those of the middle class to two, and the smallest to one. the common council had the appointment of all the judges and magistrates of the respective cities. this was certainly the most, delicate species of interference in their internal administration; for if there be any thing that seems exclusively appropriated to the local jurisdictions, it is the appointment of their own officers. yet montesquieu, speaking of this association, says: \\\"were i to give a model of an excellent confederate republic, it would be that of lycia.\\\" thus we perceive that the distinctions insisted upon were not within the contemplation of this enlightened civilian; and we shall be led to conclude, that they are the novel refinements of an erroneous theory.\", \"publius\"]\n",
       " [\"federalist no. \", \"among the numerous advantages promised by a well constructed union, none deserves to be more accurately developed than its tendency to break and control the violence of faction. the friend of popular governments never finds himself so much alarmed for their character and fate, as when he contemplates their propensity to this dangerous vice. he will not fail, therefore, to set a due value on any plan which, without violating the principles to which he is attached, provides a proper cure for it. the instability, injustice, and confusion introduced into the public councils, have, in truth, been the mortal diseases under which popular governments have everywhere perished; as they continue to be the favorite and fruitful topics from which the adversaries to liberty derive their most specious declamations. the valuable improvements made by the american constitutions on the popular models, both ancient and modern, cannot certainly be too much admired; but it would be an unwarrantable partiality, to contend that they have as effectually obviated the danger on this side, as was wished and expected. complaints are everywhere heard from our most considerate and virtuous citizens, equally the friends of public and private faith, and of public and personal liberty, that our governments are too unstable, that the public good is disregarded in the conflicts of rival parties, and that measures are too often decided, not according to the rules of justice and the rights of the minor party, but by the superior force of an interested and overbearing majority. however anxiously we may wish that these complaints had no foundation, the evidence, of known facts will not permit us to deny that they are in some degree true. it will be found, indeed, on a candid review of our situation, that some of the distresses under which we labor have been erroneously charged on the operation of our governments; but it will be found, at the same time, that other causes will not alone account for many of our heaviest misfortunes; and, particularly, for that prevailing and increasing distrust of public engagements, and alarm for private rights, which are echoed from one end of the continent to the other. these must be chiefly, if not wholly, effects of the unsteadiness and injustice with which a factious spirit has tainted our public administrations.\", \"by a faction, i understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adversed to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.\", \"there are two methods of curing the mischiefs of faction: the one, by removing its causes; the other, by controlling its effects.\", \"there are again two methods of removing the causes of faction: the one, by destroying the liberty which is essential to its existence; the other, by giving to every citizen the same opinions, the same passions, and the same interests.\", \"it could never be more truly said than of the first remedy, that it was worse than the disease. liberty is to faction what air is to fire, an aliment without which it instantly expires. but it could not be less folly to abolish liberty, which is essential to political life, because it nourishes faction, than it would be to wish the annihilation of air, which is essential to animal life, because it imparts to fire its destructive agency.\", \"the second expedient is as impracticable as the first would be unwise. as long as the reason of man continues fallible, and he is at liberty to exercise it, different opinions will be formed. as long as the connection subsists between his reason and his self-love, his opinions and his passions will have a reciprocal influence on each other; and the former will be objects to which the latter will attach themselves. the diversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of property originate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to a uniformity of interests. the protection of these faculties is the first object of government. from the protection of different and unequal faculties of acquiring property, the possession of different degrees and kinds of property immediately results; and from the influence of these on the sentiments and views of the respective proprietors, ensues a division of the society into different interests and parties.\", \"the latent causes of faction are thus sown in the nature of man; and we see them everywhere brought into different degrees of activity, according to the different circumstances of civil society. a zeal for different opinions concerning religion, concerning government, and many other points, as well of speculation as of practice; an attachment to different leaders ambitiously contending for pre-eminence and power; or to persons of other descriptions whose fortunes have been interesting to the human passions, have, in turn, divided mankind into parties, inflamed them with mutual animosity, and rendered them much more disposed to vex and oppress each other than to co-operate for their common good. so strong is this propensity of mankind to fall into mutual animosities, that where no substantial occasion presents itself, the most frivolous and fanciful distinctions have been sufficient to kindle their unfriendly passions and excite their most violent conflicts. but the most common and durable source of factions has been the various and unequal distribution of property. those who hold and those who are without property have ever formed distinct interests in society. those who are creditors, and those who are debtors, fall under a like discrimination. a landed interest, a manufacturing interest, a mercantile interest, a moneyed interest, with many lesser interests, grow up of necessity in civilized nations, and divide them into different classes, actuated by different sentiments and views. the regulation of these various and interfering interests forms the principal task of modern legislation, and involves the spirit of party and faction in the necessary and ordinary operations of the government.\", \"no man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause, because his interest would certainly bias his judgment, and, not improbably, corrupt his integrity. with equal, nay with greater reason, a body of men are unfit to be both judges and parties at the same time; yet what are many of the most important acts of legislation, but so many judicial determinations, not indeed concerning the rights of single persons, but concerning the rights of large bodies of citizens? and what are the different classes of legislators but advocates and parties to the causes which they determine? is a law proposed concerning private debts? it is a question to which the creditors are parties on one side and the debtors on the other. justice ought to hold the balance between them. yet the parties are, and must be, themselves the judges; and the most numerous party, or, in other words, the most powerful faction must be expected to prevail. shall domestic manufactures be encouraged, and in what degree, by restrictions on foreign manufactures? are questions which would be differently decided by the landed and the manufacturing classes, and probably by neither with a sole regard to justice and the public good. the apportionment of taxes on the various descriptions of property is an act which seems to require the most exact impartiality; yet there is, perhaps, no legislative act in which greater opportunity and temptation are given to a predominant party to trample on the rules of justice. every shilling with which they overburden the inferior number, is a shilling saved to their own pockets.\", \"it is in vain to say that enlightened statesmen will be able to adjust these clashing interests, and render them all subservient to the public good. enlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm. nor, in many cases, can such an adjustment be made at all without taking into view indirect and remote considerations, which will rarely prevail over the immediate interest which one party may find in disregarding the rights of another or the good of the whole.\"  …  \"the two great points of difference between a democracy and a republic are: first, the delegation of the government, in the latter, to a small number of citizens elected by the rest; secondly, the greater number of citizens, and greater sphere of country, over which the latter may be extended.\", \"the effect of the first difference is, on the one hand, to refine and enlarge the public views, by passing them through the medium of a chosen body of citizens, whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of their country, and whose patriotism and love of justice will be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial considerations. under such a regulation, it may well happen that the public voice, pronounced by the representatives of the people, will be more consonant to the public good than if pronounced by the people themselves, convened for the purpose. on the other hand, the effect may be inverted. men of factious tempers, of local prejudices, or of sinister designs, may, by intrigue, by corruption, or by other means, first obtain the suffrages, and then betray the interests, of the people. the question resulting is, whether small or extensive republics are more favorable to the election of proper guardians of the public weal; and it is clearly decided in favor of the latter by two obvious considerations:\", \"in the first place, it is to be remarked that, however small the republic may be, the representatives must be raised to a certain number, in order to guard against the cabals of a few; and that, however large it may be, they must be limited to a certain number, in order to guard against the confusion of a multitude. hence, the number of representatives in the two cases not being in proportion to that of the two constituents, and being proportionally greater in the small republic, it follows that, if the proportion of fit characters be not less in the large than in the small republic, the former will present a greater option, and consequently a greater probability of a fit choice.\", \"in the next place, as each representative will be chosen by a greater number of citizens in the large than in the small republic, it will be more difficult for unworthy candidates to practice with success the vicious arts by which elections are too often carried; and the suffrages of the people being more free, will be more likely to centre in men who possess the most attractive merit and the most diffusive and established characters.\", \"it must be confessed that in this, as in most other cases, there is a mean, on both sides of which inconveniences will be found to lie. by enlarging too much the number of electors, you render the representatives too little acquainted with all their local circumstances and lesser interests; as by reducing it too much, you render him unduly attached to these, and too little fit to comprehend and pursue great and national objects. the federal constitution forms a happy combination in this respect; the great and aggregate interests being referred to the national, the local and particular to the state legislatures.\", \"the other point of difference is, the greater number of citizens and extent of territory which may be brought within the compass of republican than of democratic government; and it is this circumstance principally which renders factious combinations less to be dreaded in the former than in the latter. the smaller the society, the fewer probably will be the distinct parties and interests composing it; the fewer the distinct parties and interests, the more frequently will a majority be found of the same party; and the smaller the number of individuals composing a majority, and the smaller the compass within which they are placed, the more easily will they concert and execute their plans of oppression. extend the sphere, and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens; or if such a common motive exists, it will be more difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength, and to act in unison with each other. besides other impediments, it may be remarked that, where there is a consciousness of unjust or dishonorable purposes, communication is always checked by distrust in proportion to the number whose concurrence is necessary.\", \"hence, it clearly appears, that the same advantage which a republic has over a democracy, in controlling the effects of faction, is enjoyed by a large over a small republic,--is enjoyed by the union over the states composing it. does the advantage consist in the substitution of representatives whose enlightened views and virtuous sentiments render them superior to local prejudices and schemes of injustice? it will not be denied that the representation of the union will be most likely to possess these requisite endowments. does it consist in the greater security afforded by a greater variety of parties, against the event of any one party being able to outnumber and oppress the rest? in an equal degree does the increased variety of parties comprised within the union, increase this security. does it, in fine, consist in the greater obstacles opposed to the concert and accomplishment of the secret wishes of an unjust and interested majority? here, again, the extent of the union gives it the most palpable advantage.\", \"the influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within their particular states, but will be unable to spread a general conflagration through the other states. a religious sect may degenerate into a political faction in a part of the confederacy; but the variety of sects dispersed over the entire face of it must secure the national councils against any danger from that source. a rage for paper money, for an abolition of debts, for an equal division of property, or for any other improper or wicked project, will be less apt to pervade the whole body of the union than a particular member of it; in the same proportion as such a malady is more likely to taint a particular county or district, than an entire state.\", \"in the extent and proper structure of the union, therefore, we behold a republican remedy for the diseases most incident to republican government. and according to the degree of pleasure and pride we feel in being republicans, ought to be our zeal in cherishing the spirit and supporting the character of federalists.\", \"publius\"]\n",

       " [\"federalist no. \", \"it has been mentioned as one of the advantages to be expected from the co-operation of the senate, in the business of appointments, that it would contribute to the stability of the administration. the consent of that body would be necessary to displace as well as to appoint. a change of the chief magistrate, therefore, would not occasion so violent or so general a revolution in the officers of the government as might be expected, if he were the sole disposer of offices. where a man in any station had given satisfactory evidence of his fitness for it, a new president would be restrained from attempting a change in favor of a person more agreeable to him, by the apprehension that a discountenance of the senate might frustrate the attempt, and bring some degree of discredit upon himself. those who can best estimate the value of a steady administration, will be most disposed to prize a provision which connects the official existence of public men with the approbation or disapprobation of that body which, from the greater permanency of its own composition, will in all probability be less subject to inconstancy than any other member of the government.\", \"to this union of the senate with the president, in the article of appointments, it has in some cases been suggested that it would serve to give the president an undue influence over the senate, and in others that it would have an opposite tendency--a strong proof that neither suggestion is true.\", \"to state the first in its proper form, is to refute it. it amounts to this: the president would have an improper influence over the senate, because the senate would have the power of restraining him. this is an absurdity in terms. it cannot admit of a doubt that the entire power of appointment would enable him much more effectually to establish a dangerous empire over that body, than a mere power of nomination subject to their control.\", \"let us take a view of the converse of the proposition: \\\"the senate would influence the executive.\\\" as i have had occasion to remark in several other instances, the indistinctness of the objection forbids a precise answer. in what manner is this influence to be exerted? in relation to what objects? the power of influencing a person, in the sense in which it is here used, must imply a power of conferring a benefit upon him. how could the senate confer a benefit upon the president by the manner of employing their right of negative upon his nominations? if it be said they might sometimes gratify him by an acquiescence in a favorite choice, when public motives might dictate a different conduct, i answer, that the instances in which the president could be personally interested in the result, would be too few to admit of his being materially affected by the compliances of the senate. the power which can originate the disposition of honors and emoluments, is more likely to attract than to be attracted by the power which can merely obstruct their course. if by influencing the president be meant restraining him, this is precisely what must have been intended. and it has been shown that the restraint would be salutary, at the same time that it would not be such as to destroy a single advantage to be looked for from the uncontrolled agency of that magistrate. the right of nomination would produce all the (good, without the ill.)(e) (good of that of appointment, and would in a great measure avoid its evils.)(e)\", \"upon a comparison of the plan for the appointment of the officers of the proposed government with that which is established by the constitution of this state, a decided preference must be given to the former. in that plan the power of nomination is unequivocally vested in the executive. and as there would be a necessity for submitting each nomination to the judgment of an entire branch of the legislature, the circumstances attending an appointment, from the mode of conducting it, would naturally become matters of notoriety; and the public would be at no loss to determine what part had been performed by the different actors. the blame of a bad nomination would fall upon the president singly and absolutely. the censure of rejecting a good one would lie entirely at the door of the senate; aggravated by the consideration of their having counteracted the good intentions of the executive. if an ill appointment should be made, the executive for nominating, and the senate for approving, would participate, though in different degrees, in the opprobrium and disgrace.\", \"the reverse of all this characterizes the manner of appointment in this state. the council of appointment consists of from three to five persons, of whom the governor is always one. this small body, shut up in a private apartment, impenetrable to the public eye, proceed to the execution of the trust committed to them. it is known that the governor claims the right of nomination, upon the strength of some ambiguous expressions in the constitution; but it is not known to what extent, or in what manner he exercises it; nor upon what occasions he is contradicted or opposed. the censure of a bad appointment, on account of the uncertainty of its author, and for want of a determinate object, has neither poignancy nor duration. and while an unbounded field for cabal and intrigue lies open, all idea of responsibility is lost. the most that the public can know, is that the governor claims the right of nomination; that two out of the inconsiderable number of four men can too often be managed without much difficulty; that if some of the members of a particular council should happen to be of an uncomplying character, it is frequently not impossible to get rid of their opposition by regulating the times of meeting in such a manner as to render their attendance inconvenient; and that from whatever cause it may proceed, a great number of very improper appointments are from time to time made. whether a governor of this state avails himself of the ascendant he must necessarily have, in this delicate and important part of the administration, to prefer to offices men who are best qualified for them, or whether he prostitutes that advantage to the advancement of persons whose chief merit is their implicit devotion to his will, and to the support of a despicable and dangerous system of personal influence, are questions which, unfortunately for the community, can only be the subjects of speculation and conjecture.\", \"every mere council of appointment, however constituted, will be a conclave, in which cabal and intrigue will have their full scope. their number, without an unwarrantable increase of expense, cannot be large enough to preclude a facility of combination. and as each member will have his friends and connections to provide for, the desire of mutual gratification will beget a scandalous bartering of votes and bargaining for places. the private attachments of one man might easily be satisfied; but to satisfy the private attachments of a dozen, or of twenty men, would occasion a monopoly of all the principal employments of the government in a few families, and would lead more directly to an aristocracy or an oligarchy than any measure that could be contrived. if, to avoid an accumulation of offices, there was to be a frequent change in the persons who were to compose the council, this would involve the mischiefs of a mutable administration in their full extent. such a council would also be more liable to executive influence than the senate, because they would be fewer in number, and would act less immediately under the public inspection. such a council, in fine, as a substitute for the plan of the convention, would be productive of an increase of expense, a multiplication of the evils which spring from favoritism and intrigue in the distribution of public honors, a decrease of stability in the administration of the government, and a diminution of the security against an undue influence of the executive. and yet such a council has been warmly contended for as an essential amendment in the proposed constitution.\", \"i could not with propriety conclude my observations on the subject of appointments without taking notice of a scheme for which there have appeared some, though but few advocates; i mean that of uniting the house of representatives in the power of making them. i shall, however, do little more than mention it, as i cannot imagine that it is likely to gain the countenance of any considerable part of the community. a body so fluctuating and at the same time so numerous, can never be deemed proper for the exercise of that power. its unfitness will appear manifest to all, when it is recollected that in half a century it may consist of three or four hundred persons. all the advantages of the stability, both of the executive and of the senate, would be defeated by this union, and infinite delays and embarrassments would be occasioned. the example of most of the states in their local constitutions encourages us to reprobate the idea.\", \"the only remaining powers of the executive are comprehended in giving information to congress of the state of the union; in recommending to their consideration such measures as he shall judge expedient; in convening them, or either branch, upon extraordinary occasions; in adjourning them when they cannot themselves agree upon the time of adjournment; in receiving ambassadors and other public ministers; in faithfully executing the laws; and in commissioning all the officers of the united states.\", \"except some cavils about the power of convening either house of the legislature, and that of receiving ambassadors, no objection has been made to this class of authorities; nor could they possibly admit of any. it required, indeed, an insatiable avidity for censure to invent exceptions to the parts which have been excepted to. in regard to the power of convening either house of the legislature, i shall barely remark, that in respect to the senate at least, we can readily discover a good reason for it. as this body has a concurrent power with the executive in the article of treaties, it might often be necessary to call it together with a view to this object, when it would be unnecessary and improper to convene the house of representatives. as to the reception of ambassadors, what i have said in a former paper will furnish a sufficient answer.\", \"we have now completed a survey of the structure and powers of the executive department, which, i have endeavored to show, combines, as far as republican principles will admit, all the requisites to energy. the remaining inquiry is: does it also combine the requisites to safety, in a republican sense--a due dependence on the people, a due responsibility? the answer to this question has been anticipated in the investigation of its other characteristics, and is satisfactorily deducible from these circumstances; from the election of the president once in four years by persons immediately chosen by the people for that purpose; and from his being at all times liable to impeachment, trial, dismission from office, incapacity to serve in any other, and to forfeiture of life and estate by subsequent prosecution in the common course of law. but these precautions, great as they are, are not the only ones which the plan of the convention has provided in favor of the public security. in the only instances in which the abuse of the executive authority was materially to be feared, the chief magistrate of the united states would, by that plan, be subjected to the control of a branch of the legislative body. what more could be desired by an enlightened and reasonable people?\", \"publius\"]\n",
       " [\"federalist no. \", \"we proceed now to an examination of the judiciary department of the proposed government.\", \"in unfolding the defects of the existing confederation, the utility and necessity of a federal judicature have been clearly pointed out. it is the less necessary to recapitulate the considerations there urged, as the propriety of the institution in the abstract is not disputed; the only questions which have been raised being relative to the manner of constituting it, and to its extent. to these points, therefore, our observations shall be confined.\", \"the manner of constituting it seems to embrace these several objects: st. the mode of appointing the judges. d. the tenure by which they are to hold their places. d. the partition of the judiciary authority between different courts, and their relations to each other.\", \"first. as to the mode of appointing the judges; this is the same with that of appointing the officers of the union in general, and has been so fully discussed in the two last numbers, that nothing can be said here which would not be useless repetition.\", \"second. as to the tenure by which the judges are to hold their places; this chiefly concerns their duration in office; the provisions for their support; the precautions for their responsibility.\", \"according to the plan of the convention, all judges who may be appointed by the united states are to hold their offices during good behavior; which is conformable to the most approved of the state constitutions and among the rest, to that of this state. its propriety having been drawn into question by the adversaries of that plan, is no light symptom of the rage for objection, which disorders their imaginations and judgments. the standard of good behavior for the continuance in office of the judicial magistracy, is certainly one of the most valuable of the modern improvements in the practice of government. in a monarchy it is an excellent barrier to the despotism of the prince; in a republic it is a no less excellent barrier to the encroachments and oppressions of the representative body. and it is the best expedient which can be devised in any government, to secure a steady, upright, and impartial administration of the laws.\", \"whoever attentively considers the different departments of power must perceive, that, in a government in which they are separated from each other, the judiciary, from the nature of its functions, will always be the least dangerous to the political rights of the constitution; because it will be least in a capacity to annoy or injure them. the executive not only dispenses the honors, but holds the sword of the community. the legislature not only commands the purse, but prescribes the rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated. the judiciary, on the contrary, has no influence over either the sword or the purse; no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the society; and can take no active resolution whatever. it may truly be said to have neither force nor will, but merely judgment; and must ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments.\", \"this simple view of the matter suggests several important consequences. it proves incontestably, that the judiciary is beyond comparison the weakest of the three departments of power; that it can never attack with success either of the other two; and that all possible care is requisite to enable it to defend itself against their attacks. it equally proves, that though individual oppression may now and then proceed from the courts of justice, the general liberty of the people can never be endangered from that quarter; i mean so long as the judiciary remains truly distinct from both the legislature and the executive. for i agree, that \\\"there is no liberty, if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers.\\\" and it proves, in the last place, that as liberty can have nothing to fear from the judiciary alone, but would have every thing to fear from its union with either of the other departments; that as all the effects of such a union must ensue from a dependence of the former on the latter, notwithstanding a nominal and apparent separation; that as, from the natural feebleness of the judiciary, it is in continual jeopardy of being overpowered, awed, or influenced by its co-ordinate branches; and that as nothing can contribute so much to its firmness and independence as permanency in office, this quality may therefore be justly regarded as an indispensable ingredient in its constitution, and, in a great measure, as the citadel of the public justice and the public security.\", \"the complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly essential in a limited constitution. by a limited constitution, i understand one which contains certain specified exceptions to the legislative authority; such, for instance, as that it shall pass no bills of attainder, no ex post facto laws, and the like. limitations of this kind can be preserved in practice no other way than through the medium of courts of justice, whose duty it must be to declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the constitution void. without this, all the reservations of particular rights or privileges would amount to nothing.\"  …  \"this exercise of judicial discretion, in determining between two contradictory laws, is exemplified in a familiar instance. it not uncommonly happens, that there are two statutes existing at one time, clashing in whole or in part with each other, and neither of them containing any repealing clause or expression. in such a case, it is the province of the courts to liquidate and fix their meaning and operation. so far as they can, by any fair construction, be reconciled to each other, reason and law conspire to dictate that this should be done; where this is impracticable, it becomes a matter of necessity to give effect to one, in exclusion of the other. the rule which has obtained in the courts for determining their relative validity is, that the last in order of time shall be preferred to the first. but this is a mere rule of construction, not derived from any positive law, but from the nature and reason of the thing. it is a rule not enjoined upon the courts by legislative provision, but adopted by themselves, as consonant to truth and propriety, for the direction of their conduct as interpreters of the law. they thought it reasonable, that between the interfering acts of an equal authority, that which was the last indication of its will should have the preference.\", \"but in regard to the interfering acts of a superior and subordinate authority, of an original and derivative power, the nature and reason of the thing indicate the converse of that rule as proper to be followed. they teach us that the prior act of a superior ought to be preferred to the subsequent act of an inferior and subordinate authority; and that accordingly, whenever a particular statute contravenes the constitution, it will be the duty of the judicial tribunals to adhere to the latter and disregard the former.\", \"it can be of no weight to say that the courts, on the pretense of a repugnancy, may substitute their own pleasure to the constitutional intentions of the legislature. this might as well happen in the case of two contradictory statutes; or it might as well happen in every adjudication upon any single statute. the courts must declare the sense of the law; and if they should be disposed to exercise will instead of judgment, the consequence would equally be the substitution of their pleasure to that of the legislative body. the observation, if it prove any thing, would prove that there ought to be no judges distinct from that body.\", \"if, then, the courts of justice are to be considered as the bulwarks of a limited constitution against legislative encroachments, this consideration will afford a strong argument for the permanent tenure of judicial offices, since nothing will contribute so much as this to that independent spirit in the judges which must be essential to the faithful performance of so arduous a duty.\", \"this independence of the judges is equally requisite to guard the constitution and the rights of individuals from the effects of those ill humors, which the arts of designing men, or the influence of particular conjunctures, sometimes disseminate among the people themselves, and which, though they speedily give place to better information, and more deliberate reflection, have a tendency, in the meantime, to occasion dangerous innovations in the government, and serious oppressions of the minor party in the community. though i trust the friends of the proposed constitution will never concur with its enemies, in questioning that fundamental principle of republican government, which admits the right of the people to alter or abolish the established constitution, whenever they find it inconsistent with their happiness, yet it is not to be inferred from this principle, that the representatives of the people, whenever a momentary inclination happens to lay hold of a majority of their constituents, incompatible with the provisions in the existing constitution, would, on that account, be justifiable in a violation of those provisions; or that the courts would be under a greater obligation to connive at infractions in this shape, than when they had proceeded wholly from the cabals of the representative body. until the people have, by some solemn and authoritative act, annulled or changed the established form, it is binding upon themselves collectively, as well as individually; and no presumption, or even knowledge, of their sentiments, can warrant their representatives in a departure from it, prior to such an act. but it is easy to see, that it would require an uncommon portion of fortitude in the judges to do their duty as faithful guardians of the constitution, where legislative invasions of it had been instigated by the major voice of the community.\", \"but it is not with a view to infractions of the constitution only, that the independence of the judges may be an essential safeguard against the effects of occasional ill humors in the society. these sometimes extend no farther than to the injury of the private rights of particular classes of citizens, by unjust and partial laws. here also the firmness of the judicial magistracy is of vast importance in mitigating the severity and confining the operation of such laws. it not only serves to moderate the immediate mischiefs of those which may have been passed, but it operates as a check upon the legislative body in passing them; who, perceiving that obstacles to the success of iniquitous intention are to be expected from the scruples of the courts, are in a manner compelled, by the very motives of the injustice they meditate, to qualify their attempts. this is a circumstance calculated to have more influence upon the character of our governments, than but few may be aware of. the benefits of the integrity and moderation of the judiciary have already been felt in more states than one; and though they may have displeased those whose sinister expectations they may have disappointed, they must have commanded the esteem and applause of all the virtuous and disinterested. considerate men, of every description, ought to prize whatever will tend to beget or fortify that temper in the courts: as no man can be sure that he may not be to-morrow the victim of a spirit of injustice, by which he may be a gainer to-day. and every man must now feel, that the inevitable tendency of such a spirit is to sap the foundations of public and private confidence, and to introduce in its stead universal distrust and distress.\", \"that inflexible and uniform adherence to the rights of the constitution, and of individuals, which we perceive to be indispensable in the courts of justice, can certainly not be expected from judges who hold their offices by a temporary commission. periodical appointments, however regulated, or by whomsoever made, would, in some way or other, be fatal to their necessary independence. if the power of making them was committed either to the executive or legislature, there would be danger of an improper complaisance to the branch which possessed it; if to both, there would be an unwillingness to hazard the displeasure of either; if to the people, or to persons chosen by them for the special purpose, there would be too great a disposition to consult popularity, to justify a reliance that nothing would be consulted but the constitution and the laws.\", \"there is yet a further and a weightier reason for the permanency of the judicial offices, which is deducible from the nature of the qualifications they require. it has been frequently remarked, with great propriety, that a voluminous code of laws is one of the inconveniences necessarily connected with the advantages of a free government. to avoid an arbitrary discretion in the courts, it is indispensable that they should be bound down by strict rules and precedents, which serve to define and point out their duty in every particular case that comes before them; and it will readily be conceived from the variety of controversies which grow out of the folly and wickedness of mankind, that the records of those precedents must unavoidably swell to a very considerable bulk, and must demand long and laborious study to acquire a competent knowledge of them. hence it is, that there can be but few men in the society who will have sufficient skill in the laws to qualify them for the stations of judges. and making the proper deductions for the ordinary depravity of human nature, the number must be still smaller of those who unite the requisite integrity with the requisite knowledge. these considerations apprise us, that the government can have no great option between fit character; and that a temporary duration in office, which would naturally discourage such characters from quitting a lucrative line of practice to accept a seat on the bench, would have a tendency to throw the administration of justice into hands less able, and less well qualified, to conduct it with utility and dignity. in the present circumstances of this country, and in those in which it is likely to be for a long time to come, the disadvantages on this score would be greater than they may at first sight appear; but it must be confessed, that they are far inferior to those which present themselves under the other aspects of the subject.\", \"upon the whole, there can be no room to doubt that the convention acted wisely in copying from the models of those constitutions which have established good behavior as the tenure of their judicial offices, in point of duration; and that so far from being blamable on this account, their plan would have been inexcusably defective, if it had wanted this important feature of good government. the experience of great britain affords an illustrious comment on the excellence of the institution.\", \"publius\"]\n",
       " [\"federalist no. \", \"next to permanency in office, nothing can contribute more to the independence of the judges than a fixed provision for their support. the remark made in relation to the president is equally applicable here. in the general course of human nature, a power over a man's subsistence amounts to a power over his will. and we can never hope to see realized in practice, the complete separation of the judicial from the legislative power, in any system which leaves the former dependent for pecuniary resources on the occasional grants of the latter. the enlightened friends to good government in every state, have seen cause to lament the want of precise and explicit precautions in the state constitutions on this head. some of these indeed have declared that permanent salaries should be established for the judges; but the experiment has in some instances shown that such expressions are not sufficiently definite to preclude legislative evasions. something still more positive and unequivocal has been evinced to be requisite. the plan of the convention accordingly has provided that the judges of the united states \\\"shall at stated times receive for their services a compensation which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.\\\"\", \"this, all circumstances considered, is the most eligible provision that could have been devised. it will readily be understood that the fluctuations in the value of money and in the state of society rendered a fixed rate of compensation in the constitution inadmissible. what might be extravagant to-day, might in half a century become penurious and inadequate. it was therefore necessary to leave it to the discretion of the legislature to vary its provisions in conformity to the variations in circumstances, yet under such restrictions as to put it out of the power of that body to change the condition of the individual for the worse. a man may then be sure of the ground upon which he stands, and can never be deterred from his duty by the apprehension of being placed in a less eligible situation. the clause which has been quoted combines both advantages. the salaries of judicial officers may from time to time be altered, as occasion shall require, yet so as never to lessen the allowance with which any particular judge comes into office, in respect to him. it will be observed that a difference has been made by the convention between the compensation of the president and of the judges, that of the former can neither be increased nor diminished; that of the latter can only not be diminished. this probably arose from the difference in the duration of the respective offices. as the president is to be elected for no more than four years, it can rarely happen that an adequate salary, fixed at the commencement of that period, will not continue to be such to its end. but with regard to the judges, who, if they behave properly, will be secured in their places for life, it may well happen, especially in the early stages of the government, that a stipend, which would be very sufficient at their first appointment, would become too small in the progress of their service.\", \"this provision for the support of the judges bears every mark of prudence and efficacy; and it may be safely affirmed that, together with the permanent tenure of their offices, it affords a better prospect of their independence than is discoverable in the constitutions of any of the states in regard to their own judges.\", \"the precautions for their responsibility are comprised in the article respecting impeachments. they are liable to be impeached for malconduct by the house of representatives, and tried by the senate; and, if convicted, may be dismissed from office, and disqualified for holding any other. this is the only provision on the point which is consistent with the necessary independence of the judicial character, and is the only one which we find in our own constitution in respect to our own judges.\", \"the want of a provision for removing the judges on account of inability has been a subject of complaint. but all considerate men will be sensible that such a provision would either not be practiced upon or would be more liable to abuse than calculated to answer any good purpose. the mensuration of the faculties of the mind has, i believe, no place in the catalogue of known arts. an attempt to fix the boundary between the regions of ability and inability, would much oftener give scope to personal and party attachments and enmities than advance the interests of justice or the public good. the result, except in the case of insanity, must for the most part be arbitrary; and insanity, without any formal or express provision, may be safely pronounced to be a virtual disqualification.\", \"the constitution of new york, to avoid investigations that must forever be vague and dangerous, has taken a particular age as the criterion of inability. no man can be a judge beyond sixty. i believe there are few at present who do not disapprove of this provision. there is no station, in relation to which it is less proper than to that of a judge. the deliberating and comparing faculties generally preserve their strength much beyond that period in men who survive it; and when, in addition to this circumstance, we consider how few there are who outlive the season of intellectual vigor, and how improbable it is that any considerable portion of the bench, whether more or less numerous, should be in such a situation at the same time, we shall be ready to conclude that limitations of this sort have little to recommend them. in a republic, where fortunes are not affluent, and pensions not expedient, the dismission of men from stations in which they have served their country long and usefully, on which they depend for subsistence, and from which it will be too late to resort to any other occupation for a livelihood, ought to have some better apology to humanity than is to be found in the imaginary danger of a superannuated bench.\", \"publius\"]\n",
       " [\"federalist no. \", \"to judge with accuracy of the proper extent of the federal judicature, it will be necessary to consider, in the first place, what are its proper objects.\", \"it seems scarcely to admit of controversy, that the judiciary authority of the union ought to extend to these several descriptions of cases: st, to all those which arise out of the laws of the united states, passed in pursuance of their just and constitutional powers of legislation;

th, to all those which originate on the high seas, and are of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction; and, lastly, to all those in which the state tribunals cannot be supposed to be impartial and unbiased.\", \"the first point depends upon this obvious consideration, that there ought always to be a constitutional method of giving efficacy to constitutional provisions. what, for instance, would avail restrictions on the authority of the state legislatures, without some constitutional mode of enforcing the observance of them? the states, by the plan of the convention, are prohibited from doing a variety of things, some of which are incompatible with the interests of the union, and others with the principles of good government. the imposition of duties on imported articles, and the emission of paper money, are specimens of each kind. no man of sense will believe, that such prohibitions would be scrupulously regarded, without some effectual power in the government to restrain or correct the infractions of them. this power must either be a direct negative on the state laws, or an authority in the federal courts to overrule such as might be in manifest contravention of the articles of union. there is no third course that i can imagine. the latter appears to have been thought by the convention preferable to the former, and, i presume, will be most agreeable to the states.\", \"as to the second point, it is impossible, by any argument or comment, to make it clearer than it is in itself. if there are such things as political axioms, the propriety of the judicial power of a government being coextensive with its legislative, may be ranked among the number. the mere necessity of uniformity in the interpretation of the national laws, decides the question. thirteen independent courts of final jurisdiction over the same causes, arising upon the same laws, is a hydra in government, from which nothing but contradiction and confusion can proceed.\", \"still less need be said in regard to the third point. controversies between the nation and its members or citizens, can only be properly referred to the national tribunals. any other plan would be contrary to reason, to precedent, and to decorum.\", \"the fourth point rests on this plain proposition, that the peace of the whole ought not to be left at the disposal of a part. the union will undoubtedly be answerable to foreign powers for the conduct of its members. and the responsibility for an injury ought ever to be accompanied with the faculty of preventing it. as the denial or perversion of justice by the sentences of courts, as well as in any other manner, is with reason classed among the just causes of war, it will follow that the federal judiciary ought to have cognizance of all causes in which the citizens of other countries are concerned. this is not less essential to the preservation of the public faith, than to the security of the public tranquillity. a distinction may perhaps be imagined between cases arising upon treaties and the laws of nations and those which may stand merely on the footing of the municipal law. the former kind may be supposed proper for the federal jurisdiction, the latter for that of the states. but it is at least problematical, whether an unjust sentence against a foreigner, where the subject of controversy was wholly relative to the lex loci, would not, if unredressed, be an aggression upon his sovereign, as well as one which violated the stipulations of a treaty or the general law of nations. and a still greater objection to the distinction would result from the immense difficulty, if not impossibility, of a practical discrimination between the cases of one complexion and those of the other. so great a proportion of the cases in which foreigners are parties, involve national questions, that it is by far most safe and most expedient to refer all those in which they are concerned to the national tribunals.\", \"the power of determining causes between two states, between one state and the citizens of another, and between the citizens of different states, is perhaps not less essential to the peace of the union than that which has been just examined. history gives us a horrid picture of the dissensions and private wars which distracted and desolated germany prior to the institution of the imperial chamber by maximilian, towards the close of the fifteenth century; and informs us, at the same time, of the vast influence of that institution in appeasing the disorders and establishing the tranquillity of the empire. this was a court invested with authority to decide finally all differences among the members of the germanic body.\", \"a method of terminating territorial disputes between the states, under the authority of the federal head, was not unattended to, even in the imperfect system by which they have been hitherto held together. but there are many other sources, besides interfering claims of boundary, from which bickerings and animosities may spring up among the members of the union. to some of these we have been witnesses in the course of our past experience. it will readily be conjectured that i allude to the fraudulent laws which have been passed in too many of the states. and though the proposed constitution establishes particular guards against the repetition of those instances which have heretofore made their appearance, yet it is warrantable to apprehend that the spirit which produced them will assume new shapes, that could not be foreseen nor specifically provided against. whatever practices may have a tendency to disturb the harmony between the states, are proper objects of federal superintendence and control.\", \"it may be esteemed the basis of the union, that \\\"the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens of the several states.\\\" and if it be a just principle that every government ought to possess the means of executing its own provisions by its own authority, it will follow, that in order to the inviolable maintenance of that equality of privileges and immunities to which the citizens of the union will be entitled, the national judiciary ought to preside in all cases in which one state or its citizens are opposed to another state or its citizens. to secure the full effect of so fundamental a provision against all evasion and subterfuge, it is necessary that its construction should be committed to that tribunal which, having no local attachments, will be likely to be impartial between the different states and their citizens, and which, owing its official existence to the union, will never be likely to feel any bias inauspicious to the principles on which it is founded.\"  …  \"it has also been asked, what need of the word \\\"equity\\\". what equitable causes can grow out of the constitution and laws of the united states? there is hardly a subject of litigation between individuals, which may not involve those ingredients of fraud, accident, trust, or hardship, which would render the matter an object of equitable rather than of legal jurisdiction, as the distinction is known and established in several of the states. it is the peculiar province, for instance, of a court of equity to relieve against what are called hard bargains: these are contracts in which, though there may have been no direct fraud or deceit, sufficient to invalidate them in a court of law, yet there may have been some undue and unconscionable advantage taken of the necessities or misfortunes of one of the parties, which a court of equity would not tolerate. in such cases, where foreigners were concerned on either side, it would be impossible for the federal judicatories to do justice without an equitable as well as a legal jurisdiction. agreements to convey lands claimed under the grants of different states, may afford another example of the necessity of an equitable jurisdiction in the federal courts. this reasoning may not be so palpable in those states where the formal and technical distinction between law and equity is not maintained, as in this state, where it is exemplified by every day's practice.\", \"the judiciary authority of the union is to extend:\", \"second. to treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the united states, and to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls. these belong to the fourth class of the enumerated cases, as they have an evident connection with the preservation of the national peace.\", \"third. to cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. these form, altogether, the fifth of the enumerated classes of causes proper for the cognizance of the national courts.\", \"fourth. to controversies to which the united states shall be a party. these constitute the third of those classes.\", \"fifth. to controversies between two or more states; between a state and citizens of another state; between citizens of different states. these belong to the fourth of those classes, and partake, in some measure, of the nature of the last.\", \"sixth. to cases between the citizens of the same state, claiming lands under grants of different states. these fall within the last class, and are the only instances in which the proposed constitution directly contemplates the cognizance of disputes between the citizens of the same state.\", \"seventh. to cases between a state and the citizens thereof, and foreign states, citizens, or subjects. these have been already explained to belong to the fourth of the enumerated classes, and have been shown to be, in a peculiar manner, the proper subjects of the national judicature.\", \"from this review of the particular powers of the federal judiciary, as marked out in the constitution, it appears that they are all conformable to the principles which ought to have governed the structure of that department, and which were necessary to the perfection of the system. if some partial inconveniences should appear to be connected with the incorporation of any of them into the plan, it ought to be recollected that the national legislature will have ample authority to make such exceptions, and to prescribe such regulations as will be calculated to obviate or remove these inconveniences. the possibility of particular mischiefs can never be viewed, by a wellinformed mind, as a solid objection to a general principle, which is calculated to avoid general mischiefs and to obtain general advantages.\", \"publius\"]\n",
       " [\"federalist no. \", \"let us now return to the partition of the judiciary authority between different courts, and their relations to each other.\", \"\\\"the judicial power of the united states is\\\" (by the plan of the convention) \\\"to be vested in one supreme court, and in such inferior courts as the congress may, from time to time, ordain and establish.\\\"\", \"that there ought to be one court of supreme and final jurisdiction, is a proposition which is not likely to be contested. the reasons for it have been assigned in another place, and are too obvious to need repetition. the only question that seems to have been raised concerning it, is, whether it ought to be a distinct body or a branch of the legislature. the same contradiction is observable in regard to this matter which has been remarked in several other cases. the very men who object to the senate as a court of impeachments, on the ground of an improper intermixture of powers, advocate, by implication at least, the propriety of vesting the ultimate decision of all causes, in the whole or in a part of the legislative body.\", \"the arguments, or rather suggestions, upon which this charge is founded, are to this effect: \\\"the authority of the proposed supreme court of the united states, which is to be a separate and independent body, will be superior to that of the legislature. the power of construing the laws according to the spirit of the constitution, will enable that court to mould them into whatever shape it may think proper; especially as its decisions will not be in any manner subject to the revision or correction of the legislative body. this is as unprecedented as it is dangerous. in britain, the judicial power, in the last resort, resides in the house of lords, which is a branch of the legislature; and this part of the british government has been imitated in the state constitutions in general. the parliament of great britain, and the legislatures of the several states, can at any time rectify, by law, the exceptionable decisions of their respective courts. but the errors and usurpations of the supreme court of the united states will be uncontrollable and remediless.\\\" this, upon examination, will be found to be made up altogether of false reasoning upon misconceived fact.\", \"in the first place, there is not a syllable in the plan under consideration which directly empowers the national courts to construe the laws according to the spirit of the constitution, or which gives them any greater latitude in this respect than may be claimed by the courts of every state. i admit, however, that the constitution ought to be the standard of construction for the laws, and that wherever there is an evident opposition, the laws ought to give place to the constitution. but this doctrine is not deducible from any circumstance peculiar to the plan of the convention, but from the general theory of a limited constitution; and as far as it is true, is equally applicable to most, if not to all the state governments. there can be no objection, therefore, on this account, to the federal judicature which will not lie against the local judicatures in general, and which will not serve to condemn every constitution that attempts to set bounds to legislative discretion.\", \"but perhaps the force of the objection may be thought to consist in the particular organization of the supreme court; in its being composed of a distinct body of magistrates, instead of being one of the branches of the legislature, as in the government of great britain and that of the state. to insist upon this point, the authors of the objection must renounce the meaning they have labored to annex to the celebrated maxim, requiring a separation of the departments of power. it shall, nevertheless, be conceded to them, agreeably to the interpretation given to that maxim in the course of these papers, that it is not violated by vesting the ultimate power of judging in a part of the legislative body. but though this be not an absolute violation of that excellent rule, yet it verges so nearly upon it, as on this account alone to be less eligible than the mode preferred by the convention. from a body which had even a partial agency in passing bad laws, we could rarely expect a disposition to temper and moderate them in the application. the same spirit which had operated in making them, would be too apt in interpreting them; still less could it be expected that men who had infringed the constitution in the character of legislators, would be disposed to repair the breach in the character of judges. nor is this all. every reason which recommends the tenure of good behavior for judicial offices, militates against placing the judiciary power, in the last resort, in a body composed of men chosen for a limited period. there is an absurdity in referring the determination of causes, in the first instance, to judges of permanent standing; in the last, to those of a temporary and mutable constitution. and there is a still greater absurdity in subjecting the decisions of men, selected for their knowledge of the laws, acquired by long and laborious study, to the revision and control of men who, for want of the same advantage, cannot but be deficient in that knowledge. the members of the legislature will rarely be chosen with a view to those qualifications which fit men for the stations of judges; and as, on this account, there will be great reason to apprehend all the ill consequences of defective information, so, on account of the natural propensity of such bodies to party divisions, there will be no less reason to fear that the pestilential breath of faction may poison the fountains of justice. the habit of being continually marshalled on opposite sides will be too apt to stifle the voice both of law and of equity.\", \"these considerations teach us to applaud the wisdom of those states who have committed the judicial power, in the last resort, not to a part of the legislature, but to distinct and independent bodies of men. contrary to the supposition of those who have represented the plan of the convention, in this respect, as novel and unprecedented, it is but a copy of the constitutions of new hampshire, massachusetts, pennsylvania, delaware, maryland, virginia, north carolina, south carolina, and georgia; and the preference which has been given to those models is highly to be commended.\", \"it is not true, in the second place, that the parliament of great britain, or the legislatures of the particular states, can rectify the exceptionable decisions of their respective courts, in any other sense than might be done by a future legislature of the united states. the theory, neither of the british, nor the state constitutions, authorizes the revisal of a judicial sentence by a legislative act. nor is there any thing in the proposed constitution, more than in either of them, by which it is forbidden. in the former, as well as in the latter, the impropriety of the thing, on the general principles of law and reason, is the sole obstacle. a legislature, without exceeding its province, cannot reverse a determination once made in a particular case; though it may prescribe a new rule for future cases. this is the principle, and it applies in all its consequences, exactly in the same manner and extent, to the state governments, as to the national government now under consideration. not the least difference can be pointed out in any view of the subject.\", \"it may in the last place be observed that the supposed danger of judiciary encroachments on the legislative authority, which has been upon many occasions reiterated, is in reality a phantom. particular misconstructions and contraventions of the will of the legislature may now and then happen; but they can never be so extensive as to amount to an inconvenience, or in any sensible degree to affect the order of the political system. this may be inferred with certainty, from the general nature of the judicial power, from the objects to which it relates, from the manner in which it is exercised, from its comparative weakness, and from its total incapacity to support its usurpations by force. and the inference is greatly fortified by the consideration of the important constitutional check which the power of instituting impeachments in one part of the legislative body, and of determining upon them in the other, would give to that body upon the members of the judicial department. this is alone a complete security. there never can be danger that the judges, by a series of deliberate usurpations on the authority of the legislature, would hazard the united resentment of the body intrusted with it, while this body was possessed of the means of punishing their presumption, by degrading them from their stations. while this ought to remove all apprehensions on the subject, it affords, at the same time, a cogent argument for constituting the senate a court for the trial of impeachments.\"  …  \"the supreme court is to be invested with original jurisdiction, only \\\"in cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls, and those in which a state shall be a party.\\\" public ministers of every class are the immediate representatives of their sovereigns. all questions in which they are concerned are so directly connected with the public peace, that, as well for the preservation of this, as out of respect to the sovereignties they represent, it is both expedient and proper that such questions should be submitted in the first instance to the highest judicatory of the nation. though consuls have not in strictness a diplomatic character, yet as they are the public agents of the nations to which they belong, the same observation is in a great measure applicable to them. in cases in which a state might happen to be a party, it would ill suit its dignity to be turned over to an inferior tribunal.\", \"though it may rather be a digression from the immediate subject of this paper, i shall take occasion to mention here a supposition which has excited some alarm upon very mistaken grounds. it has been suggested that an assignment of the public securities of one state to the citizens of another, would enable them to prosecute that state in the federal courts for the amount of those securities; a suggestion which the following considerations prove to be without foundation.\", \"it is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual without its consent. this is the general sense, and the general practice of mankind; and the exemption, as one of the attributes of sovereignty, is now enjoyed by the government of every state in the union. unless, therefore, there is a surrender of this immunity in the plan of the convention, it will remain with the states, and the danger intimated must be merely ideal. the circumstances which are necessary to produce an alienation of state sovereignty were discussed in considering the article of taxation, and need not be repeated here. a recurrence to the principles there established will satisfy us, that there is no color to pretend that the state governments would, by the adoption of that plan, be divested of the privilege of paying their own debts in their own way, free from every constraint but that which flows from the obligations of good faith. the contracts between a nation and individuals are only binding on the conscience of the sovereign, and have no pretensions to a compulsive force. they confer no right of action, independent of the sovereign will. to what purpose would it be to authorize suits against states for the debts they owe? how could recoveries be enforced? it is evident, it could not be done without waging war against the contracting state; and to ascribe to the federal courts, by mere implication, and in destruction of a pre-existing right of the state governments, a power which would involve such a consequence, would be altogether forced and unwarrantable.\", \"let us resume the train of our observations. we have seen that the original jurisdiction of the supreme court would be confined to two classes of causes, and those of a nature rarely to occur. in all other cases of federal cognizance, the original jurisdiction would appertain to the inferior tribunals; and the supreme court would have nothing more than an appellate jurisdiction, \\\"with such exceptions and under such regulations as the congress shall make.\\\"\", \"the propriety of this appellate jurisdiction has been scarcely called in question in regard to matters of law; but the clamors have been loud against it as applied to matters of fact. some well-intentioned men in this state, deriving their notions from the language and forms which obtain in our courts, have been induced to consider it as an implied supersedure of the trial by jury, in favor of the civil-law mode of trial, which prevails in our courts of admiralty, probate, and chancery. a technical sense has been affixed to the term \\\"appellate,\\\" which, in our law parlance, is commonly used in reference to appeals in the course of the civil law. but if i am not misinformed, the same meaning would not be given to it in any part of new england. there an appeal from one jury to another, is familiar both in language and practice, and is even a matter of course, until there have been two verdicts on one side. the word \\\"appellate,\\\" therefore, will not be understood in the same sense in new england as in new york, which shows the impropriety of a technical interpretation derived from the jurisprudence of any particular state. the expression, taken in the abstract, denotes nothing more than the power of one tribunal to review the proceedings of another, either as to the law or fact, or both. the mode of doing it may depend on ancient custom or legislative provision (in a new government it must depend on the latter), and may be with or without the aid of a jury, as may be judged advisable. if, therefore, the re-examination of a fact once determined by a jury, should in any case be admitted under the proposed constitution, it may be so regulated as to be done by a second jury, either by remanding the cause to the court below for a second trial of the fact, or by directing an issue immediately out of the supreme court.\", \"but it does not follow that the re-examination of a fact once ascertained by a jury, will be permitted in the supreme court. why may not it be said, with the strictest propriety, when a writ of error is brought from an inferior to a superior court of law in this state, that the latter has jurisdiction of the fact as well as the law? it is true it cannot institute a new inquiry concerning the fact, but it takes cognizance of it as it appears upon the record, and pronounces the law arising upon it. this is jurisdiction of both fact and law; nor is it even possible to separate them. though the common-law courts of this state ascertain disputed facts by a jury, yet they unquestionably have jurisdiction of both fact and law; and accordingly when the former is agreed in the pleadings, they have no recourse to a jury, but proceed at once to judgment. i contend, therefore, on this ground, that the expressions, \\\"appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact,\\\" do not necessarily imply a re-examination in the supreme court of facts decided by juries in the inferior courts.\", \"the following train of ideas may well be imagined to have influenced the convention, in relation to this particular provision. the appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court (it may have been argued) will extend to causes determinable in different modes, some in the course of the common law, others in the course of the civil law. in the former, the revision of the law only will be, generally speaking, the proper province of the supreme court; in the latter, the re-examination of the fact is agreeable to usage, and in some cases, of which prize causes are an example, might be essential to the preservation of the public peace. it is therefore necessary that the appellate jurisdiction should, in certain cases, extend in the broadest sense to matters of fact. it will not answer to make an express exception of cases which shall have been originally tried by a jury, because in the courts of some of the states all causes are tried in this mode; and such an exception would preclude the revision of matters of fact, as well where it might be proper, as where it might be improper. to avoid all inconveniencies, it will be safest to declare generally, that the supreme court shall possess appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact, and that this jurisdiction shall be subject to such exceptions and regulations as the national legislature may prescribe. this will enable the government to modify it in such a manner as will best answer the ends of public justice and security.\", \"this view of the matter, at any rate, puts it out of all doubt that the supposed abolition of the trial by jury, by the operation of this provision, is fallacious and untrue. the legislature of the united states would certainly have full power to provide, that in appeals to the supreme court there should be no re-examination of facts where they had been tried in the original causes by juries. this would certainly be an authorized exception; but if, for the reason already intimated, it should be thought too extensive, it might be qualified with a limitation to such causes only as are determinable at common law in that mode of trial.\", \"the amount of the observations hitherto made on the authority of the judicial department is this: that it has been carefully restricted to those causes which are manifestly proper for the cognizance of the national judicature; that in the partition of this authority a very small portion of original jurisdiction has been preserved to the supreme court, and the rest consigned to the subordinate tribunals; that the supreme court will possess an appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, in all the cases referred to them, both subject to any exceptions and regulations which may be thought advisable; that this appellate jurisdiction does, in no case, abolish the trial by jury; and that an ordinary degree of prudence and integrity in the national councils will insure us solid advantages from the establishment of the proposed judiciary, without exposing us to any of the inconveniences which have been predicted from that source.\", \"publius\"]\n",
       " [\"federalist no. \", \"the erection of a new government, whatever care or wisdom may distinguish the work, cannot fail to originate questions of intricacy and nicety; and these may, in a particular manner, be expected to flow from the establishment of a constitution founded upon the total or partial incorporation of a number of distinct sovereignties. 'tis time only that can mature and perfect so compound a system, can liquidate the meaning of all the parts, and can adjust them to each other in a harmonious and consistent whole.\", \"such questions, accordingly, have arisen upon the plan proposed by the convention, and particularly concerning the judiciary department. the principal of these respect the situation of the state courts in regard to those causes which are to be submitted to federal jurisdiction. is this to be exclusive, or are those courts to possess a concurrent jurisdiction? if the latter, in what relation will they stand to the national tribunals? these are inquiries which we meet with in the mouths of men of sense, and which are certainly entitled to attention.\", \"the principles established in a former paper teach us that the states will retain all pre-existing authorities which may not be exclusively delegated to the federal head; and that this exclusive delegation can only exist in one of three cases: where an exclusive authority is, in express terms, granted to the union; or where a particular authority is granted to the union, and the exercise of a like authority is prohibited to the states; or where an authority is granted to the union, with which a similar authority in the states would be utterly incompatible. though these principles may not apply with the same force to the judiciary as to the legislative power, yet i am inclined to think that they are, in the main, just with respect to the former, as well as the latter. and under this impression, i shall lay it down as a rule, that the state courts will retain the jurisdiction they now have, unless it appears to be taken away in one of the enumerated modes.\", \"the only thing in the proposed constitution, which wears the appearance of confining the causes of federal cognizance to the federal courts, is contained in this passage: \\\"the judicial power of the united states shall be vested in one supreme court, and in such inferior courts as the congress shall from time to time ordain and establish.\\\" this might either be construed to signify, that the supreme and subordinate courts of the union should alone have the power of deciding those causes to which their authority is to extend; or simply to denote, that the organs of the national judiciary should be one supreme court, and as many subordinate courts as congress should think proper to appoint; or in other words, that the united states should exercise the judicial power with which they are to be invested, through one supreme tribunal, and a certain number of inferior ones, to be instituted by them. the first excludes, the last admits, the concurrent jurisdiction of the state tribunals; and as the first would amount to an alienation of state power by implication, the last appears to me the most natural and the most defensible construction.\", \"but this doctrine of concurrent jurisdiction is only clearly applicable to those descriptions of causes of which the state courts have previous cognizance. it is not equally evident in relation to cases which may grow out of, and be peculiar to, the constitution to be established; for not to allow the state courts a right of jurisdiction in such cases, can hardly be considered as the abridgment of a pre-existing authority. i mean not therefore to contend that the united states, in the course of legislation upon the objects intrusted to their direction, may not commit the decision of causes arising upon a particular regulation to the federal courts solely, if such a measure should be deemed expedient; but i hold that the state courts will be divested of no part of their primitive jurisdiction, further than may relate to an appeal; and i am even of opinion that in every case in which they were not expressly excluded by the future acts of the national legislature, they will of course take cognizance of the causes to which those acts may give birth. this i infer from the nature of judiciary power, and from the general genius of the system. the judiciary power of every government looks beyond its own local or municipal laws, and in civil cases lays hold of all subjects of litigation between parties within its jurisdiction, though the causes of dispute are relative to the laws of the most distant part of the globe. those of japan, not less than of new york, may furnish the objects of legal discussion to our courts. when in addition to this we consider the state governments and the national governments, as they truly are, in the light of kindred systems, and as parts of one whole, the inference seems to be conclusive, that the state courts would have a concurrent jurisdiction in all cases arising under the laws of the union, where it was not expressly prohibited.\", \"here another question occurs: what relation would subsist between the national and state courts in these instances of concurrent jurisdiction? i answer, that an appeal would certainly lie from the latter, to the supreme court of the united states. the constitution in direct terms gives an appellate jurisdiction to the supreme court in all the enumerated cases of federal cognizance in which it is not to have an original one, without a single expression to confine its operation to the inferior federal courts. the objects of appeal, not the tribunals from which it is to be made, are alone contemplated. from this circumstance, and from the reason of the thing, it ought to be construed to extend to the state tribunals. either this must be the case, or the local courts must be excluded from a concurrent jurisdiction in matters of national concern, else the judiciary authority of the union may be eluded at the pleasure of every plaintiff or prosecutor. neither of these consequences ought, without evident necessity, to be involved; the latter would be entirely inadmissible, as it would defeat some of the most important and avowed purposes of the proposed government, and would essentially embarrass its measures. nor do i perceive any foundation for such a supposition. agreeably to the remark already made, the national and state systems are to be regarded as one whole. the courts of the latter will of course be natural auxiliaries to the execution of the laws of the union, and an appeal from them will as naturally lie to that tribunal which is destined to unite and assimilate the principles of national justice and the rules of national decisions. the evident aim of the plan of the convention is, that all the causes of the specified classes shall, for weighty public reasons, receive their original or final determination in the courts of the union. to confine, therefore, the general expressions giving appellate jurisdiction to the supreme court, to appeals from the subordinate federal courts, instead of allowing their extension to the state courts, would be to abridge the latitude of the terms, in subversion of the intent, contrary to every sound rule of interpretation.\", \"but could an appeal be made to lie from the state courts to the subordinate federal judicatories? this is another of the questions which have been raised, and of greater difficulty than the former. the following considerations countenance the affirmative. the plan of the convention, in the first place, authorizes the national legislature \\\"to constitute tribunals inferior to the supreme court.\\\" it declares, in the next place, that \\\"the judicial power of the united states shall be vested in one supreme court, and in such inferior courts as congress shall ordain and establish\\\"; and it then proceeds to enumerate the cases to which this judicial power shall extend. it afterwards divides the jurisdiction of the supreme court into original and appellate, but gives no definition of that of the subordinate courts. the only outlines described for them, are that they shall be \\\"inferior to the supreme court,\\\" and that they shall not exceed the specified limits of the federal judiciary. whether their authority shall be original or appellate, or both, is not declared. all this seems to be left to the discretion of the legislature. and this being the case, i perceive at present no impediment to the establishment of an appeal from the state courts to the subordinate national tribunals; and many advantages attending the power of doing it may be imagined. it would diminish the motives to the multiplication of federal courts, and would admit of arrangements calculated to contract the appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court. the state tribunals may then be left with a more entire charge of federal causes; and appeals, in most cases in which they may be deemed proper, instead of being carried to the supreme court, may be made to lie from the state courts to district courts of the union.\", \"publius\"]\n",
       " [\"federalist no. \", \"the objection to the plan of the convention, which has met with most success in this state, and perhaps in several of the other states, is that relative to the want of a constitutional provision for the trial by jury in civil cases. the disingenuous form in which this objection is usually stated has been repeatedly adverted to and exposed, but continues to be pursued in all the conversations and writings of the opponents of the plan. the mere silence of the constitution in regard to civil causes, is represented as an abolition of the trial by jury, and the declamations to which it has afforded a pretext are artfully calculated to induce a persuasion that this pretended abolition is complete and universal, extending not only to every species of civil, but even to criminal causes. to argue with respect to the latter would, however, be as vain and fruitless as to attempt the serious proof of the existence of matter, or to demonstrate any of those propositions which, by their own internal evidence, force conviction, when expressed in language adapted to convey their meaning.\", \"with regard to civil causes, subtleties almost too contemptible for refutation have been employed to countenance the surmise that a thing which is only not provided for, is entirely abolished. every man of discernment must at once perceive the wide difference between silence and abolition. but as the inventors of this fallacy have attempted to support it by certain legal maxims of interpretation, which they have perverted from their true meaning, it may not be wholly useless to explore the ground they have taken.\", \"the maxims on which they rely are of this nature: \\\"a specification of particulars is an exclusion of generals\\\"; or, \\\"the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another.\\\" hence, say they, as the constitution has established the trial by jury in criminal cases, and is silent in respect to civil, this silence is an implied prohibition of trial by jury in regard to the latter.\", \"the rules of legal interpretation are rules of common sense, adopted by the courts in the construction of the laws. the true test, therefore, of a just application of them is its conformity to the source from which they are derived. this being the case, let me ask if it is consistent with common-sense to suppose that a provision obliging the legislative power to commit the trial of criminal causes to juries, is a privation of its right to authorize or permit that mode of trial in other cases? is it natural to suppose, that a command to do one thing is a prohibition to the doing of another, which there was a previous power to do, and which is not incompatible with the thing commanded to be done? if such a supposition would be unnatural and unreasonable, it cannot be rational to maintain that an injunction of the trial by jury in certain cases is an interdiction of it in others.\", \"a power to constitute courts is a power to prescribe the mode of trial; and consequently, if nothing was said in the constitution on the subject of juries, the legislature would be at liberty either to adopt that institution or to let it alone. this discretion, in regard to criminal causes, is abridged by the express injunction of trial by jury in all such cases; but it is, of course, left at large in relation to civil causes, there being a total silence on this head. the specification of an obligation to try all criminal causes in a particular mode, excludes indeed the obligation or necessity of employing the same mode in civil causes, but does not abridge the power of the legislature to exercise that mode if it should be thought proper. the pretense, therefore, that the national legislature would not be at full liberty to submit all the civil causes of federal cognizance to the determination of juries, is a pretense destitute of all just foundation.\", \"from these observations this conclusion results: that the trial by jury in civil cases would not be abolished; and that the use attempted to be made of the maxims which have been quoted, is contrary to reason and common-sense, and therefore not admissible. even if these maxims had a precise technical sense, corresponding with the idea of those who employ them upon the present occasion, which, however, is not the case, they would still be inapplicable to a constitution of government. in relation to such a subject, the natural and obvious sense of its provisions, apart from any technical rules, is the true criterion of construction.\", \"having now seen that the maxims relied upon will not bear the use made of them, let us endeavor to ascertain their proper use and true meaning. this will be best done by examples. the plan of the convention declares that the power of congress, or, in other words, of the national legislature, shall extend to certain enumerated cases. this specification of particulars evidently excludes all pretension to a general legislative authority, because an affirmative grant of special powers would be absurd, as well as useless, if a general authority was intended.\", \"in like manner the judicial authority of the federal judicatures is declared by the constitution to comprehend certain cases particularly specified. the expression of those cases marks the precise limits, beyond which the federal courts cannot extend their jurisdiction, because the objects of their cognizance being enumerated, the specification would be nugatory if it did not exclude all ideas of more extensive authority.\", \"these examples are sufficient to elucidate the maxims which have been mentioned, and to designate the manner in which they should be used. but that there may be no misapprehensions upon this subject, i shall add one case more, to demonstrate the proper use of these maxims, and the abuse which has been made of them.\"  …  \"but this is not all: if we advert to the observations already made respecting the courts that subsist in the several states of the union, and the different powers exercised by them, it will appear that there are no expressions more vague and indeterminate than those which have been employed to characterize that species of causes which it is intended shall be entitled to a trial by jury. in this state, the boundaries between actions at common law and actions of equitable jurisdiction, are ascertained in conformity to the rules which prevail in england upon that subject. in many of the other states the boundaries are less precise. in some of them every cause is to be tried in a court of common law, and upon that foundation every action may be considered as an action at common law, to be determined by a jury, if the parties, or either of them, choose it. hence the same irregularity and confusion would be introduced by a compliance with this proposition, that i have already noticed as resulting from the regulation proposed by the pennsylvania minority. in one state a cause would receive its determination from a jury, if the parties, or either of them, requested it; but in another state, a cause exactly similar to the other, must be decided without the intervention of a jury, because the state judicatories varied as to common-law jurisdiction.\", \"it is obvious, therefore, that the massachusetts proposition, upon this subject cannot operate as a general regulation, until some uniform plan, with respect to the limits of common-law and equitable jurisdictions, shall be adopted by the different states. to devise a plan of that kind is a task arduous in itself, and which it would require much time and reflection to mature. it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to suggest any general regulation that would be acceptable to all the states in the union, or that would perfectly quadrate with the several state institutions.\", \"it may be asked, why could not a reference have been made to the constitution of this state, taking that, which is allowed by me to be a good one, as a standard for the united states? i answer that it is not very probable the other states would entertain the same opinion of our institutions as we do ourselves. it is natural to suppose that they are hitherto more attached to their own, and that each would struggle for the preference. if the plan of taking one state as a model for the whole had been thought of in the convention, it is to be presumed that the adoption of it in that body would have been rendered difficult by the predilection of each representation in favor of its own government; and it must be uncertain which of the states would have been taken as the model. it has been shown that many of them would be improper ones. and i leave it to conjecture, whether, under all circumstances, it is most likely that new york, or some other state, would have been preferred. but admit that a judicious selection could have been effected in the convention, still there would have been great danger of jealousy and disgust in the other states, at the partiality which had been shown to the institutions of one. the enemies of the plan would have been furnished with a fine pretext for raising a host of local prejudices against it, which perhaps might have hazarded, in no inconsiderable degree, its final establishment.\", \"to avoid the embarrassments of a definition of the cases which the trial by jury ought to embrace, it is sometimes suggested by men of enthusiastic tempers, that a provision might have been inserted for establishing it in all cases whatsoever. for this i believe, no precedent is to be found in any member of the union; and the considerations which have been stated in discussing the proposition of the minority of pennsylvania, must satisfy every sober mind that the establishment of the trial by jury in all cases would have been an unpardonable error in the plan.\", \"in short, the more it is considered the more arduous will appear the task of fashioning a provision in such a form as not to express too little to answer the purpose, or too much to be advisable; or which might not have opened other sources of opposition to the great and essential object of introducing a firm national government.\", \"i cannot but persuade myself, on the other hand, that the different lights in which the subject has been placed in the course of these observations, will go far towards removing in candid minds the apprehensions they may have entertained on the point. they have tended to show that the security of liberty is materially concerned only in the trial by jury in criminal cases, which is provided for in the most ample manner in the plan of the convention; that even in far the greatest proportion of civil cases, and those in which the great body of the community is interested, that mode of trial will remain in its full force, as established in the state constitutions, untouched and unaffected by the plan of the convention; that it is in no case abolished by that plan; and that there are great if not insurmountable difficulties in the way of making any precise and proper provision for it in a constitution for the united states.\", \"the best judges of the matter will be the least anxious for a constitutional establishment of the trial by jury in civil cases, and will be the most ready to admit that the changes which are continually happening in the affairs of society may render a different mode of determining questions of property preferable in many cases in which that mode of trial now prevails. for my part, i acknowledge myself to be convinced that even in this state it might be advantageously extended to some cases to which it does not at present apply, and might as advantageously be abridged in others. it is conceded by all reasonable men that it ought not to obtain in all cases. the examples of innovations which contract its ancient limits, as well in these states as in great britain, afford a strong presumption that its former extent has been found inconvenient, and give room to suppose that future experience may discover the propriety and utility of other exceptions. i suspect it to be impossible in the nature of the thing to fix the salutary point at which the operation of the institution ought to stop, and this is with me a strong argument for leaving the matter to the discretion of the legislature.\", \"this is now clearly understood to be the case in great britain, and it is equally so in the state of connecticut; and yet it may be safely affirmed that more numerous encroachments have been made upon the trial by jury in this state since the revolution, though provided for by a positive article of our constitution, than has happened in the same time either in connecticut or great britain. it may be added that these encroachments have generally originated with the men who endeavor to persuade the people they are the warmest defenders of popular liberty, but who have rarely suffered constitutional obstacles to arrest them in a favorite career. the truth is that the general genius of a government is all that can be substantially relied upon for permanent effects. particular provisions, though not altogether useless, have far less virtue and efficacy than are commonly ascribed to them; and the want of them will never be, with men of sound discernment, a decisive objection to any plan which exhibits the leading characters of a good government.\", \"it certainly sounds not a little harsh and extraordinary to affirm that there is no security for liberty in a constitution which expressly establishes the trial by jury in criminal cases, because it does not do it in civil also; while it is a notorious fact that connecticut, which has been always regarded as the most popular state in the union, can boast of no constitutional provision for either.\", \"publius\"]\n",
       " [\"federalist no. \", \"in the course of the foregoing review of the constitution, i have taken notice of, and endeavored to answer most of the objections which have appeared against it. there, however, remain a few which either did not fall naturally under any particular head or were forgotten in their proper places. these shall now be discussed; but as the subject has been drawn into great length, i shall so far consult brevity as to comprise all my observations on these miscellaneous points in a single paper.\", \"the most considerable of the remaining objections is that the plan of the convention contains no bill of rights. among other answers given to this, it has been upon different occasions remarked that the constitutions of several of the states are in a similar predicament. i add that new york is of the number. and yet the opposers of the new system, in this state, who profess an unlimited admiration for its constitution, are among the most intemperate partisans of a bill of rights. to justify their zeal in this matter, they allege two things: one is that, though the constitution of new york has no bill of rights prefixed to it, yet it contains, in the body of it, various provisions in favor of particular privileges and rights, which, in substance amount to the same thing; the other is, that the constitution adopts, in their full extent, the common and statute law of great britain, by which many other rights, not expressed in it, are equally secured.\", \"to the first i answer, that the constitution proposed by the convention contains, as well as the constitution of this state, a number of such provisions.\", \"independent of those which relate to the structure of the government, we find the following: article , section , clause --\\\"judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the united states; but the party convicted shall, nevertheless, be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment, and punishment according to law.\\\" section , of the same article, clause --\\\"the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.\\\" clause --\\\"no bill of attainder or ex-post-facto law shall be passed.\\\" clause --\\\"no title of nobility shall be granted by the united states; and no person holding any office of profit or trust under them, shall, without the consent of the congress, accept of any present, emolument, office, or title of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state.\\\" article , section , clause --\\\"the trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury; and such trial shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any state, the trial shall be at such place or places as the congress may by law have directed.\\\" section , of the same article--\\\"treason against the united states shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. no person shall be convicted of treason, unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.\\\" and clause , of the same section--\\\"the congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason; but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture, except during the life of the person attainted.\\\"\", \"it may well be a question, whether these are not, upon the whole, of equal importance with any which are to be found in the constitution of this state. the establishment of the writ of habeas corpus, the prohibition of ex post facto laws, and of titles of nobility, to which we have no corresponding provision in our constitution, are perhaps greater securities to liberty and republicanism than any it contains. the creation of crimes after the commission of the fact, or, in other words, the subjecting of men to punishment for things which, when they were done, were breaches of no law, and the practice of arbitrary imprisonments, have been, in all ages, the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny. the observations of the judicious blackstone, in reference to the latter, are well worthy of recital: \\\"to bereave a man of life, (says he) or by violence to confiscate his estate, without accusation or trial, would be so gross and notorious an act of despotism, as must at once convey the alarm of tyranny throughout the whole nation; but confinement of the person, by secretly hurrying him to jail, where his sufferings are unknown or forgotten, is a less public, a less striking, and therefore a more dangerous engine of arbitrary government.\\\" and as a remedy for this fatal evil he is everywhere peculiarly emphatical in his encomiums on the habeas corpus act, which in one place he calls \\\"the bulwark of the british constitution.\\\"\", \"nothing need be said to illustrate the importance of the prohibition of titles of nobility. this may truly be denominated the corner-stone of republican government; for so long as they are excluded, there can never be serious danger that the government will be any other than that of the people.\", \"to the second that is, to the pretended establishment of the common and state law by the constitution, i answer, that they are expressly made subject \\\"to such alterations and provisions as the legislature shall from time to time make concerning the same.\\\" they are therefore at any moment liable to repeal by the ordinary legislative power, and of course have no constitutional sanction. the only use of the declaration was to recognize the ancient law and to remove doubts which might have been occasioned by the revolution. this consequently can be considered as no part of a declaration of rights, which under our constitutions must be intended as limitations of the power of the government itself.\", \"it has been several times truly remarked that bills of rights are, in their origin, stipulations between kings and their subjects, abridgements of prerogative in favor of privilege, reservations of rights not surrendered to the prince. such was magna charta, obtained by the barons, sword in hand, from king john. such were the subsequent confirmations of that charter by succeeding princes. such was the petition of right assented to by charles i., in the beginning of his reign. such, also, was the declaration of right presented by the lords and commons to the prince of orange in , and afterwards thrown into the form of an act of parliament called the bill of rights. it is evident, therefore, that, according to their primitive signification, they have no application to constitutions professedly founded upon the power of the people, and executed by their immediate representatives and servants. here, in strictness, the people surrender nothing; and as they retain every thing they have no need of particular reservations. \\\"we, the people of the united states, to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution for the united states of america.\\\" here is a better recognition of popular rights, than volumes of those aphorisms which make the principal figure in several of our state bills of rights, and which would sound much better in a treatise of ethics than in a constitution of government.\", \"but a minute detail of particular rights is certainly far less applicable to a constitution like that under consideration, which is merely intended to regulate the general political interests of the nation, than to a constitution which has the regulation of every species of personal and private concerns. if, therefore, the loud clamors against the plan of the convention, on this score, are well founded, no epithets of reprobation will be too strong for the constitution of this state. but the truth is, that both of them contain all which, in relation to their objects, is reasonably to be desired.\"  …  \"among the many curious objections which have appeared against the proposed constitution, the most extraordinary and the least colorable is derived from the want of some provision respecting the debts due to the united states. this has been represented as a tacit relinquishment of those debts, and as a wicked contrivance to screen public defaulters. the newspapers have teemed with the most inflammatory railings on this head; yet there is nothing clearer than that the suggestion is entirely void of foundation, the offspring of extreme ignorance or extreme dishonesty. in addition to the remarks i have made upon the subject in another place, i shall only observe that as it is a plain dictate of common-sense, so it is also an established doctrine of political law, that \\\"states neither lose any of their rights, nor are discharged from any of their obligations, by a change in the form of their civil government.\\\"\", \"the last objection of any consequence, which i at present recollect, turns upon the article of expense. if it were even true, that the adoption of the proposed government would occasion a considerable increase of expense, it would be an objection that ought to have no weight against the plan.\", \"the great bulk of the citizens of america are with reason convinced, that union is the basis of their political happiness. men of sense of all parties now, with few exceptions, agree that it cannot be preserved under the present system, nor without radical alterations; that new and extensive powers ought to be granted to the national head, and that these require a different organization of the federal government--a single body being an unsafe depositary of such ample authorities. in conceding all this, the question of expense must be given up; for it is impossible, with any degree of safety, to narrow the foundation upon which the system is to stand. the two branches of the legislature are, in the first instance, to consist of only sixty-five persons, which is the same number of which congress, under the existing confederation, may be composed. it is true that this number is intended to be increased; but this is to keep pace with the progress of the population and resources of the country. it is evident that a less number would, even in the first instance, have been unsafe, and that a continuance of the present number would, in a more advanced stage of population, be a very inadequate representation of the people.\", \"whence is the dreaded augmentation of expense to spring? one source indicated, is the multiplication of offices under the new government. let us examine this a little.\", \"it is evident that the principal departments of the administration under the present government, are the same which will be required under the new. there are now a secretary of war, a secretary of foreign affairs, a secretary for domestic affairs, a board of treasury, consisting of three persons, a treasurer, assistants, clerks, etc. these officers are indispensable under any system, and will suffice under the new as well as the old. as to ambassadors and other ministers and agents in foreign countries, the proposed constitution can make no other difference than to render their characters, where they reside, more respectable, and their services more useful. as to persons to be employed in the collection of the revenues, it is unquestionably true that these will form a very considerable addition to the number of federal officers; but it will not follow that this will occasion an increase of public expense. it will be in most cases nothing more than an exchange of state for national officers. in the collection of all duties, for instance, the persons employed will be wholly of the latter description. the states individually will stand in no need of any for this purpose. what difference can it make in point of expense to pay officers of the customs appointed by the state or by the united states? there is no good reason to suppose that either the number or the salaries of the latter will be greater than those of the former.\", \"where then are we to seek for those additional articles of expense which are to swell the account to the enormous size that has been represented to us? the chief item which occurs to me respects the support of the judges of the united states. i do not add the president, because there is now a president of congress, whose expenses may not be far, if any thing, short of those which will be incurred on account of the president of the united states. the support of the judges will clearly be an extra expense, but to what extent will depend on the particular plan which may be adopted in regard to this matter. but upon no reasonable plan can it amount to a sum which will be an object of material consequence.\", \"let us now see what there is to counterbalance any extra expense that may attend the establishment of the proposed government. the first thing which presents itself is that a great part of the business which now keeps congress sitting through the year will be transacted by the president. even the management of foreign negotiations will naturally devolve upon him, according to general principles concerted with the senate, and subject to their final concurrence. hence it is evident that a portion of the year will suffice for the session of both the senate and the house of representatives; we may suppose about a fourth for the latter and a third, or perhaps half, for the former. the extra business of treaties and appointments may give this extra occupation to the senate. from this circumstance we may infer that, until the house of representatives shall be increased greatly beyond its present number, there will be a considerable saving of expense from the difference between the constant session of the present and the temporary session of the future congress.\", \"but there is another circumstance of great importance in the view of economy. the business of the united states has hitherto occupied the state legislatures, as well as congress. the latter has made requisitions which the former have had to provide for. hence it has happened that the sessions of the state legislatures have been protracted greatly beyond what was necessary for the execution of the mere local business of the states. more than half their time has been frequently employed in matters which related to the united states. now the members who compose the legislatures of the several states amount to two thousand and upwards, which number has hitherto performed what under the new system will be done in the first instance by sixty-five persons, and probably at no future period by above a fourth or fifth of that number. the congress under the proposed government will do all the business of the united states themselves, without the intervention of the state legislatures, who thenceforth will have only to attend to the affairs of their particular states, and will not have to sit in any proportion as long as they have heretofore done. this difference in the time of the sessions of the state legislatures will be clear gain, and will alone form an article of saving, which may be regarded as an equivalent for any additional objects of expense that may be occasioned by the adoption of the new system.\", \"the result from these observations is that the sources of additional expense from the establishment of the proposed constitution are much fewer than may have been imagined; that they are counterbalanced by considerable objects of saving; and that while it is questionable on which side the scale will preponderate, it is certain that a government less expensive would be incompetent to the purposes of the union.\", \"publius\"]\n",
       " [\"federalist no. \", \"according to the formal division of the subject of these papers, announced in my first number, there would appear still to remain for discussion two points: \\\"the analogy of the proposed government to your own state constitution,\\\" and \\\"the additional security which its adoption will afford to republican government, to liberty, and to property.\\\" but these heads have been so fully anticipated and exhausted in the progress of the work, that it would now scarcely be possible to do any thing more than repeat, in a more dilated form, what has been heretofore said, which the advanced stage of the question, and the time already spent upon it, conspire to forbid.\", \"it is remarkable, that the resemblance of the plan of the convention to the act which organizes the government of this state holds, not less with regard to many of the supposed defects, than to the real excellences of the former. among the pretended defects are the re-eligibility of the executive, the want of a council, the omission of a formal bill of rights, the omission of a provision respecting the liberty of the press. these and several others which have been noted in the course of our inquiries are as much chargeable on the existing constitution of this state, as on the one proposed for the union; and a man must have slender pretensions to consistency, who can rail at the latter for imperfections which he finds no difficulty in excusing in the former. nor indeed can there be a better proof of the insincerity and affectation of some of the zealous adversaries of the plan of the convention among us, who profess to be the devoted admirers of the government under which they live, than the fury with which they have attacked that plan, for matters in regard to which our own constitution is equally or perhaps more vulnerable.\", \"the additional securities to republican government, to liberty and to property, to be derived from the adoption of the plan under consideration, consist chiefly in the restraints which the preservation of the union will impose on local factions and insurrections, and on the ambition of powerful individuals in single states, who may acquire credit and influence enough, from leaders and favorites, to become the despots of the people; in the diminution of the opportunities to foreign intrigue, which the dissolution of the confederacy would invite and facilitate; in the prevention of extensive military establishments, which could not fail to grow out of wars between the states in a disunited situation; in the express guaranty of a republican form of government to each; in the absolute and universal exclusion of titles of nobility; and in the precautions against the repetition of those practices on the part of the state governments which have undermined the foundations of property and credit, have planted mutual distrust in the breasts of all classes of citizens, and have occasioned an almost universal prostration of morals.\", \"thus have i, fellow-citizens, executed the task i had assigned to myself; with what success, your conduct must determine. i trust at least you will admit that i have not failed in the assurance i gave you respecting the spirit with which my endeavors should be conducted. i have addressed myself purely to your judgments, and have studiously avoided those asperities which are too apt to disgrace political disputants of all parties, and which have been not a little provoked by the language and conduct of the opponents of the constitution. the charge of a conspiracy against the liberties of the people, which has been indiscriminately brought against the advocates of the plan, has something in it too wanton and too malignant, not to excite the indignation of every man who feels in his own bosom a refutation of the calumny. the perpetual changes which have been rung upon the wealthy, the well-born, and the great, have been such as to inspire the disgust of all sensible men. and the unwarrantable concealments and misrepresentations which have been in various ways practiced to keep the truth from the public eye, have been of a nature to demand the reprobation of all honest men. it is not impossible that these circumstances may have occasionally betrayed me into intemperances of expression which i did not intend; it is certain that i have frequently felt a struggle between sensibility and moderation; and if the former has in some instances prevailed, it must be my excuse that it has been neither often nor much.\", \"let us now pause and ask ourselves whether, in the course of these papers, the proposed constitution has not been satisfactorily vindicated from the aspersions thrown upon it; and whether it has not been shown to be worthy of the public approbation, and necessary to the public safety and prosperity. every man is bound to answer these questions to himself, according to the best of his conscience and understanding, and to act agreeably to the genuine and sober dictates of his judgment. this is a duty from which nothing can give him a dispensation. 't is one that he is called upon, nay, constrained by all the obligations that form the bands of society, to discharge sincerely and honestly. no partial motive, no particular interest, no pride of opinion, no temporary passion or prejudice, will justify to himself, to his country, or to his posterity, an improper election of the part he is to act. let him beware of an obstinate adherence to party; let him reflect that the object upon which he is to decide is not a particular interest of the community, but the very existence of the nation; and let him remember that a majority of america has already given its sanction to the plan which he is to approve or reject.\", \"i shall not dissemble that i feel an entire confidence in the arguments which recommend the proposed system to your adoption, and that i am unable to discern any real force in those by which it has been opposed. i am persuaded that it is the best which our political situation, habits, and opinions will admit, and superior to any the revolution has produced.\", \"concessions on the part of the friends of the plan, that it has not a claim to absolute perfection, have afforded matter of no small triumph to its enemies. \\\"why,\\\" say they, \\\"should we adopt an imperfect thing? why not amend it and make it perfect before it is irrevocably established?\\\" this may be plausible enough, but it is only plausible. in the first place i remark, that the extent of these concessions has been greatly exaggerated. they have been stated as amounting to an admission that the plan is radically defective, and that without material alterations the rights and the interests of the community cannot be safely confided to it. this, as far as i have understood the meaning of those who make the concessions, is an entire perversion of their sense. no advocate of the measure can be found, who will not declare as his sentiment, that the system, though it may not be perfect in every part, is, upon the whole, a good one; is the best that the present views and circumstances of the country will permit; and is such an one as promises every species of security which a reasonable people can desire.\", \"i answer in the next place, that i should esteem it the extreme of imprudence to prolong the precarious state of our national affairs, and to expose the union to the jeopardy of successive experiments, in the chimerical pursuit of a perfect plan. i never expect to see a perfect work from imperfect man. the result of the deliberations of all collective bodies must necessarily be a compound, as well of the errors and prejudices, as of the good sense and wisdom, of the individuals of whom they are composed. the compacts which are to embrace thirteen distinct states in a common bond of amity and union, must as necessarily be a compromise of as many dissimilar interests and inclinations. how can perfection spring from such materials?\", \"the reasons assigned in an excellent little pamphlet lately published in this city, are unanswerable to show the utter improbability of assembling a new convention, under circumstances in any degree so favorable to a happy issue, as those in which the late convention met, deliberated, and concluded. i will not repeat the arguments there used, as i presume the production itself has had an extensive circulation. it is certainly well worthy the perusal of every friend to his country. there is, however, one point of light in which the subject of amendments still remains to be considered, and in which it has not yet been exhibited to public view. i cannot resolve to conclude without first taking a survey of it in this aspect.\", \"it appears to me susceptible of absolute demonstration, that it will be far more easy to obtain subsequent than previous amendments to the constitution. the moment an alteration is made in the present plan, it becomes, to the purpose of adoption, a new one, and must undergo a new decision of each state. to its complete establishment throughout the union, it will therefore require the concurrence of thirteen states. if, on the contrary, the constitution proposed should once be ratified by all the states as it stands, alterations in it may at any time be effected by nine states. here, then, the chances are as thirteen to nine in favor of subsequent amendment, rather than of the original adoption of an entire system.\", \"this is not all. every constitution for the united states must inevitably consist of a great variety of particulars, in which thirteen independent states are to be accommodated in their interests or opinions of interest. we may of course expect to see, in any body of men charged with its original formation, very different combinations of the parts upon different points. many of those who form a majority on one question, may become the minority on a second, and an association dissimilar to either may constitute the majority on a third. hence the necessity of moulding and arranging all the particulars which are to compose the whole, in such a manner as to satisfy all the parties to the compact; and hence, also, an immense multiplication of difficulties and casualties in obtaining the collective assent to a final act. the degree of that multiplication must evidently be in a ratio to the number of particulars and the number of parties.\", \"but every amendment to the constitution, if once established, would be a single proposition, and might be brought forward singly. there would then be no necessity for management or compromise, in relation to any other point--no giving nor taking. the will of the requisite number would at once bring the matter to a decisive issue. and consequently, whenever nine, or rather ten states, were united in the desire of a particular amendment, that amendment must infallibly take place. there can, therefore, be no comparison between the facility of affecting an amendment, and that of establishing in the first instance a complete constitution.\", \"in opposition to the probability of subsequent amendments, it has been urged that the persons delegated to the administration of the national government will always be disinclined to yield up any portion of the authority of which they were once possessed. for my own part i acknowledge a thorough conviction that any amendments which may, upon mature consideration, be thought useful, will be applicable to the organization of the government, not to the mass of its powers; and on this account alone, i think there is no weight in the observation just stated. i also think there is little weight in it on another account. the intrinsic difficulty of governing thirteen states at any rate, independent of calculations upon an ordinary degree of public spirit and integrity, will, in my opinion constantly impose on the national rulers the necessity of a spirit of accommodation to the reasonable expectations of their constituents. but there is yet a further consideration, which proves beyond the possibility of a doubt, that the observation is futile. it is this that the national rulers, whenever nine states concur, will have no option upon the subject. by the fifth article of the plan, the congress will be obliged \\\"on the application of the legislatures of two thirds of the states (which at present amount to nine), to call a convention for proposing amendments, which shall be valid, to all intents and purposes, as part of the constitution, when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the states, or by conventions in three fourths thereof.\\\" the words of this article are peremptory. the congress \\\"shall call a convention.\\\" nothing in this particular is left to the discretion of that body. and of consequence, all the declamation about the disinclination to a change vanishes in air. nor however difficult it may be supposed to unite two thirds or three fourths of the state legislatures, in amendments which may affect local interests, can there be any room to apprehend any such difficulty in a union on points which are merely relative to the general liberty or security of the people. we may safely rely on the disposition of the state legislatures to erect barriers against the encroachments of the national authority.\", \"if the foregoing argument is a fallacy, certain it is that i am myself deceived by it, for it is, in my conception, one of those rare instances in which a political truth can be brought to the test of a mathematical demonstration. those who see the matter in the same light with me, however zealous they may be for amendments, must agree in the propriety of a previous adoption, as the most direct road to their own object.\", \"the zeal for attempts to amend, prior to the establishment of the constitution, must abate in every man who is ready to accede to the truth of the following observations of a writer equally solid and ingenious: \\\"to balance a large state or society (says he), whether monarchical or republican, on general laws, is a work of so great difficulty, that no human genius, however comprehensive, is able, by the mere dint of reason and reflection, to effect it. the judgments of many must unite in the work; experience must guide their labor; time must bring it to perfection, and the feeling of inconveniences must correct the mistakes which they inevitably fall into in their first trials and experiments.\\\" these judicious reflections contain a lesson of moderation to all the sincere lovers of the union, and ought to put them upon their guard against hazarding anarchy, civil war, a perpetual alienation of the states from each other, and perhaps the military despotism of a victorious demagogue, in the pursuit of what they are not likely to obtain, but from time and experience. it may be in me a defect of political fortitude, but i acknowledge that i cannot entertain an equal tranquillity with those who affect to treat the dangers of a longer continuance in our present situation as imaginary. a nation, without a national government, is, in my view, an awful spectacle. the establishment of a constitution, in time of profound peace, by the voluntary consent of a whole people, is a prodigy, to the completion of which i look forward with trembling anxiety. i can reconcile it to no rules of prudence to let go the hold we now have, in so arduous an enterprise, upon seven out of the thirteen states, and after having passed over so considerable a part of the ground, to recommence the course. i dread the more the consequences of new attempts, because i know that powerful individuals, in this and in other states, are enemies to a general national government in every possible shape.\", \"publius\"]"
