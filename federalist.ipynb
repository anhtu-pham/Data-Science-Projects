      "AFTER an unequivocal experience of the inefficacy of the subsisting\r\n",
      "federal government, you are called upon to deliberate on a new\r\n",
      "Constitution for the United States of America. The subject speaks its\r\n",
      "own importance; comprehending in its consequences nothing less than the\r\n",
      "existence of the UNION, the safety and welfare of the parts of which it\r\n",
      "is composed, the fate of an empire in many respects the most interesting\r\n",
      "in the world. It has been frequently remarked that it seems to have been\r\n",
      "reserved to the people of this country, by their conduct and example,\r\n",
      "to decide the important question, whether societies of men are really\r\n",
      "capable or not of establishing good government from reflection and\r\n",
      "choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend for their\r\n",
      "political constitutions on accident and force. If there be any truth\r\n",
      "in the remark, the crisis at which we are arrived may with propriety be\r\n",
      "regarded as the era in which that decision is to be made; and a wrong\r\n",
      "election of the part we shall act may, in this view, deserve to be\r\n",
      "considered as the general misfortune of mankind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This idea will add the inducements of philanthropy to those of\r\n",
      "patriotism, to heighten the solicitude which all considerate and good\r\n",
      "men must feel for the event. Happy will it be if our choice should be\r\n",
      "directed by a judicious estimate of our true interests, unperplexed and\r\n",
      "unbiased by considerations not connected with the public good. But this\r\n",
      "is a thing more ardently to be wished than seriously to be expected. The\r\n",
      "plan offered to our deliberations affects too many particular interests,\r\n",
      "innovates upon too many local institutions, not to involve in its\r\n",
      "discussion a variety of objects foreign to its merits, and of views,\r\n",
      "passions and prejudices little favorable to the discovery of truth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Among the most formidable of the obstacles which the new Constitution\r\n",
      "will have to encounter may readily be distinguished the obvious interest\r\n",
      "of a certain class of men in every State to resist all changes which\r\n",
      "may hazard a diminution of the power, emolument, and consequence of\r\n",
      "the offices they hold under the State establishments; and the perverted\r\n",
      "ambition of another class of men, who will either hope to aggrandize\r\n",
      "themselves by the confusions of their country, or will flatter\r\n",
      "themselves with fairer prospects of elevation from the subdivision of\r\n",
      "the empire into several partial confederacies than from its union under\r\n",
      "one government.\r\n",

      "It is not, however, my design to dwell upon observations of this\r\n",

      "indiscriminately the opposition of any set of men (merely because their\r\n",
      "situations might subject them to suspicion) into interested or ambitious\r\n",
      "views. Candor will oblige us to admit that even such men may be actuated\r\n",
      "by upright intentions; and it cannot be doubted that much of the\r\n",
      "opposition which has made its appearance, or may hereafter make its\r\n",
      "appearance, will spring from sources, blameless at least, if not\r\n",
      "respectable--the honest errors of minds led astray by preconceived\r\n",
      "jealousies and fears. So numerous indeed and so powerful are the causes\r\n",
      "which serve to give a false bias to the judgment, that we, upon many\r\n",
      "occasions, see wise and good men on the wrong as well as on the right\r\n",
      "side of questions of the first magnitude to society. This circumstance,\r\n",
      "if duly attended to, would furnish a lesson of moderation to those\r\n",
      "who are ever so much persuaded of their being in the right in any\r\n",
      "controversy. And a further reason for caution, in this respect, might\r\n",
      "be drawn from the reflection that we are not always sure that those\r\n",
      "who advocate the truth are influenced by purer principles than their\r\n",
      "antagonists. Ambition, avarice, personal animosity, party opposition,\r\n",
      "and many other motives not more laudable than these, are apt to operate\r\n",
      "as well upon those who support as those who oppose the right side of a\r\n",
      "question. Were there not even these inducements to moderation, nothing\r\n",
      "could be more ill-judged than that intolerant spirit which has, at all\r\n",
      "times, characterized political parties. For in politics, as in religion,\r\n",
      "it is equally absurd to aim at making proselytes by fire and sword.\r\n",

      "former cases of great national discussion. A torrent of angry and\r\n",
      "malignant passions will be let loose. To judge from the conduct of the\r\n",
      "opposite parties, we shall be led to conclude that they will mutually\r\n",
      "hope to evince the justness of their opinions, and to increase the\r\n",
      "number of their converts by the loudness of their declamations and the\r\n",
      "bitterness of their invectives. An enlightened zeal for the energy\r\n",
      "and efficiency of government will be stigmatized as the offspring of a\r\n",
      "temper fond of despotic power and hostile to the principles of liberty.\r\n",
      "An over-scrupulous jealousy of danger to the rights of the people,\r\n",
      "which is more commonly the fault of the head than of the heart, will be\r\n",
      "represented as mere pretense and artifice, the stale bait for popularity\r\n",
      "at the expense of the public good. It will be forgotten, on the one\r\n",
      "hand, that jealousy is the usual concomitant of love, and that the noble\r\n",
      "enthusiasm of liberty is apt to be infected with a spirit of narrow and\r\n",
      "illiberal distrust. On the other hand, it will be equally forgotten that\r\n",
      "the vigor of government is essential to the security of liberty; that,\r\n",
      "in the contemplation of a sound and well-informed judgment, their\r\n",
      "interest can never be separated; and that a dangerous ambition more\r\n",
      "often lurks behind the specious mask of zeal for the rights of the\r\n",
      "people than under the forbidden appearance of zeal for the firmness and\r\n",
      "efficiency of government. History will teach us that the former has been\r\n",
      "found a much more certain road to the introduction of despotism than\r\n",
