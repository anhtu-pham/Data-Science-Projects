      "to decide the important question, whether societies of men are really\n",
      "capable or not of establishing good government from reflection and\n",
      "choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend for their\n",
      "political constitutions on accident and force. If there be any truth\n",
      "in the remark, the crisis at which we are arrived may with propriety be\n",
      "regarded as the era in which that decision is to be made; and a wrong\n",

      "considered as the general misfortune of mankind.\n",

      "directed by a judicious estimate of our true interests, unperplexed and\n",
      "unbiased by considerations not connected with the public good. But this\n",
      "is a thing more ardently to be wished than seriously to be expected. The\n",
      "plan offered to our deliberations affects too many particular interests,\n",
      "innovates upon too many local institutions, not to involve in its\n",
      "discussion a variety of objects foreign to its merits, and of views,\n",

      "\n",

      "may hazard a diminution of the power, emolument, and consequence of\n",
      "the offices they hold under the State establishments; and the perverted\n",

      "side of questions of the first magnitude to society. This circumstance,\n",
      "if duly attended to, would furnish a lesson of moderation to those\n",
      "who are ever so much persuaded of their being in the right in any\n",
      "controversy. And a further reason for caution, in this respect, might\n",
      "be drawn from the reflection that we are not always sure that those\n",
      "who advocate the truth are influenced by purer principles than their\n",
      "antagonists. Ambition, avarice, personal animosity, party opposition,\n",
      "and many other motives not more laudable than these, are apt to operate\n",
      "as well upon those who support as those who oppose the right side of a\n",
      "question. Were there not even these inducements to moderation, nothing\n",
      "could be more ill-judged than that intolerant spirit which has, at all\n",

      "bitterness of their invectives. An enlightened zeal for the energy\n",

      "An over-scrupulous jealousy of danger to the rights of the people,\n",
      "which is more commonly the fault of the head than of the heart, will be\n",

      "interest can never be separated; and that a dangerous ambition more\n",
