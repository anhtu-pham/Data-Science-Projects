Saturday, October 27, 1787\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHAMILTON\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\r\\n\\r\\nAFTER an unequivocal experience of the inefficacy of the subsisting\\r\\nfederal government, you are called upon to deliberate on a new\\r\\nConstitution for the United States of America. The subject speaks its\\r\\nown importance; comprehending in its consequences nothing less than the\\r\\nexistence of the UNION, the safety and welfare of the parts of which it\\r\\nis composed, the fate of an empire in many respects the most interesting\\r\\nin the world. It has been frequently remarked that it seems to have been\\r\\nreserved to the people of this country, by their conduct and example,\\r\\nto decide the important question, whether societies of men are really\\r\\ncapable or not of establishing good government from reflection and\\r\\nchoice, or whether they are forever destined to depend for their\\r\\npolitical constitutions on accident and force. If there be any truth\\r\\nin the remark, the crisis at which we are arrived may with propriety be\\r\\nregarded as the era in which that decision is to be made; and a wrong\\r\\nelection of the part we shall act may, in this view, deserve to be\\r\\nconsidered as the general misfortune of mankind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis idea will add the inducements of philanthropy to those of\\r\\npatriotism, to heighten the solicitude which all considerate and good\\r\\nmen must feel for the event. Happy will it be if our choice should be\\r\\ndirected by a judicious estimate of our true interests, unperplexed and\\r\\nunbiased by considerations not connected with the public good. But this\\r\\nis a thing more ardently to be wished than seriously to be expected. The\\r\\nplan offered to our deliberations affects too many particular interests,\\r\\ninnovates upon too many local institutions, not to involve in its\\r\\ndiscussion a variety of objects foreign to its merits, and of views,\\r\\npassions and prejudices little favorable to the discovery of truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the most formidable of the obstacles which the new Constitution\\r\\nwill have to encounter may readily be distinguished the obvious interest\\r\\nof a certain class of men in every State to resist all changes which\\r\\nmay hazard a diminution of the power, emolument, and consequence of\\r\\nthe offices they hold under the State establishments; and the perverted\\r\\nambition of another class of men, who will either hope to aggrandize\\r\\nthemselves by the confusions of their country, or will flatter\\r\\nthemselves with fairer prospects of elevation from the subdivision of\\r\\nthe empire into several partial confederacies than from its union under\\r\\none government.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not, however, my design to dwell upon observations of this\\r\\nnature. I am well aware that it would be disingenuous to resolve\\r\\nindiscriminately the opposition of any set of men (merely because their\\r\\nsituations might subject them to suspicion) into interested or ambitious\\r\\nviews. Candor will oblige us to admit that even such men may be actuated\\r\\nby upright intentions; and it cannot be doubted that much of the\\r\\nopposition which has made its appearance, or may hereafter make its\\r\\nappearance, will spring from sources, blameless at least, if not\\r\\nrespectable--the honest errors of minds led astray by preconceived\\r\\njealousies and fears. So numerous indeed and so powerful are the causes\\r\\nwhich serve to give a false bias to the judgment, that we, upon many\\r\\noccasions, see wise and good men on the wrong as well as on the right\\r\\nside of questions of the first magnitude to society. This circumstance,\\r\\nif duly attended to, would furnish a lesson of moderation to those\\r\\nwho are ever so much persuaded of their being in the right in any\\r\\ncontroversy. And a further reason for caution, in this respect, might\\r\\nbe drawn from the reflection that we are not always sure that those\\r\\nwho advocate the truth are influenced by purer principles than their\\r\\nantagonists. Ambition, avarice, personal animosity, party opposition,\\r\\nand many other motives not more laudable than these, are apt to operate\\r\\nas well upon those who support as those who oppose the right side of a\\r\\nquestion. Were there not even these inducements to moderation, nothing\\r\\ncould be more ill-judged than that intolerant spirit which has, at all\\r\\ntimes, characterized political parties. For in politics, as in religion,\\r\\nit is equally absurd to aim at making proselytes by fire and sword.\\r\\nHeresies in either can rarely be cured by persecution.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet, however just these sentiments will be allowed to be, we have\\r\\nalready sufficient indications that it will happen in this as in all\\r\\nformer cases of great national discussion. A torrent of angry and\\r\\nmalignant passions will be let loose. To judge from the conduct of the\\r\\nopposite parties, we shall be led to conclude that they will mutually\\r\\nhope to evince the justness of their opinions, and to increase the\\r\\nnumber of their converts by the loudness of their declamations and the\\r\\nbitterness of their invectives. An enlightened zeal for the energy\\r\\nand efficiency of government will be stigmatized as the offspring of a\\r\\ntemper fond of despotic power and hostile to the principles of liberty.\\r\\nAn over-scrupulous jealousy of danger to the rights of the people,\\r\\nwhich is more commonly the fault of the head than of the heart, will be\\r\\nrepresented as mere pretense and artifice, the stale bait for popularity\\r\\nat the expense of the public good. It will be forgotten, on the one\\r\\nhand, that jealousy is the usual concomitant of love, and that the noble\\r\\nenthusiasm of liberty is apt to be infected with a spirit of narrow and\\r\\nilliberal distrust. On the other hand, it will be equally forgotten that\\r\\nthe vigor of government is essential to the security of liberty; that,\\r\\nin the contemplation of a sound and well-informed judgment, their\\r\\ninterest can never be separated; and that a dangerous ambition more\\r\\noften lurks behind the specious mask of zeal for the rights of the\\r\\npeople than under the forbidden appearance of zeal for the firmness and\\r\\nefficiency of government. History will teach us that the former has been\\r\\nfound a much more certain road to the introduction of despotism than\\r\\nthe latter, and that of those men who have overturned the liberties\\r\\nof republics, the greatest number have begun their career by paying\\r\\nan obsequious court to the people; commencing demagogues, and ending\\r\\ntyrants.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the course of the preceding observations, I have had an eye, my\\r\\nfellow-citizens, to putting you upon your guard against all attempts,\\r\\nfrom whatever quarter, to influence your decision in a matter of the\\r\\nutmost moment to your welfare, by any impressions other than those which\\r\\nmay result from the evidence of truth. You will, no doubt, at the same\\r\\ntime, have collected from the general scope of them, that they\\r\\nproceed from a source not unfriendly to the new Constitution. Yes,\\r\\nmy countrymen, I own to you that, after having given it an attentive\\r\\nconsideration, I am clearly of opinion it is your interest to adopt it.\\r\\nI am convinced that this is the safest course for your liberty, your\\r\\ndignity, and your happiness. I affect not reserves which I do not feel.\\r\\nI will not amuse you with an appearance of deliberation when I have\\r\\ndecided. I frankly acknowledge to you my convictions, and I will freely\\r\\nlay before you the reasons on which they are founded. The consciousness\\r\\nof good intentions disdains ambiguity. I shall not, however, multiply\\r\\nprofessions on this head. My motives must remain in the depository of\\r\\nmy own breast. My arguments will be open to all, and may be judged of by\\r\\nall. They shall at least be offered in a spirit which will not disgrace\\r\\nthe cause of truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nI propose, in a series of papers, to discuss the following interesting\\r\\nparticulars:\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE UTILITY OF THE UNION TO YOUR POLITICAL PROSPERITY THE INSUFFICIENCY\\r\\nOF THE PRESENT CONFEDERATION TO PRESERVE THAT UNION THE NECESSITY OF\\r\\nA GOVERNMENT AT LEAST EQUALLY ENERGETIC WITH THE ONE PROPOSED, TO THE\\r\\nATTAINMENT OF THIS OBJECT THE CONFORMITY OF THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTION\\r\\nTO THE TRUE PRINCIPLES OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT ITS ANALOGY TO YOUR\\r\\nOWN STATE CONSTITUTION and lastly, THE ADDITIONAL SECURITY WHICH ITS\\r\\nADOPTION WILL AFFORD TO THE PRESERVATION OF THAT SPECIES OF GOVERNMENT,\\r\\nTO LIBERTY, AND TO PROPERTY.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the progress of this discussion I shall endeavor to give a\\r\\nsatisfactory answer to all the objections which shall have made their\\r\\nappearance, that may seem to have any claim to your attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may perhaps be thought superfluous to offer arguments to prove the\\r\\nutility of the UNION, a point, no doubt, deeply engraved on the hearts\\r\\nof the great body of the people in every State, and one, which it may be\\r\\nimagined, has no adversaries. But the fact is, that we already hear\\r\\nit whispered in the private circles of those who oppose the new\\r\\nConstitution, that the thirteen States are of too great extent for\\r\\nany general system, and that we must of necessity resort to separate\\r\\nconfederacies of distinct portions of the whole.(1) This doctrine will,\\r\\nin all probability, be gradually propagated, till it has votaries enough\\r\\nto countenance an open avowal of it. For nothing can be more evident,\\r\\nto those who are able to take an enlarged view of the subject, than the\\r\\nalternative of an adoption of the new Constitution or a dismemberment\\r\\nof the Union. It will therefore be of use to begin by examining the\\r\\nadvantages of that Union, the certain evils, and the probable dangers,\\r\\nto which every State will be exposed from its dissolution. This shall\\r\\naccordingly constitute the subject of my next address.\\r\\n\\r\\nPUBLIUS\\r\\n\\r\\n1. The same idea, tracing the arguments to their consequences, is held\\r\\nout in several of the late publications against the new Constitution.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\", \"\\r\\n\\r\\nConcerning Dangers from Foreign Force and Influence\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the Independent Journal. Wednesday, October 31, 1787\\r\\n\\r\\nJAY\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\r\\n\\r\\nWHEN the people of America reflect that they are now called upon to\\r\\ndecide a question, which, in its consequences, must prove one of the\\r\\nmost important that ever engaged their attention, the propriety of their\\r\\ntaking a very comprehensive, as well as a very serious, view of it, will\\r\\nbe evident.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing is more certain than the indispensable necessity of government,\\r\\nand it is equally undeniable, that whenever and however it is\\r\\ninstituted, the people must cede to it some of their natural rights\\r\\nin order to vest it with requisite powers. It is well worthy of\\r\\nconsideration therefore, whether it would conduce more to the interest\\r\\nof the people of America that they should, to all general purposes, be\\r\\none nation, under one federal government, or that they should divide\\r\\nthemselves into separate confederacies, and give to the head of each\\r\\nthe same kind of powers which they are advised to place in one national\\r\\ngovernment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has until lately been a received and uncontradicted opinion that the\\r\\nprosperity of the people of America depended on their continuing firmly\\r\\nunited, and the wishes, prayers, and efforts of our best and wisest\\r\\ncitizens have been constantly directed to that object. But politicians\\r\\nnow appear, who insist that this opinion is erroneous, and that instead\\r\\nof looking for safety and happiness in union, we ought to seek it in\\r\\na division of the States into distinct confederacies or sovereignties.\\r\\nHowever extraordinary this new doctrine may appear, it nevertheless\\r\\nhas its advocates; and certain characters who were much opposed to it\\r\\nformerly, are at present of the number. Whatever may be the arguments\\r\\nor inducements which have wrought this change in the sentiments and\\r\\ndeclarations of these gentlemen, it certainly would not be wise in the\\r\\npeople at large to adopt these new political tenets without being fully\\r\\nconvinced that they are founded in truth and sound policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has often given me pleasure to observe that independent America\\r\\nwas not composed of detached and distant territories, but that one\\r\\nconnected, fertile, wide-spreading country was the portion of our western\\r\\nsons of liberty. Providence has in a particular manner blessed it with\\r\\na variety of soils and productions, and watered it with innumerable\\r\\nstreams, for the delight and accommodation of its inhabitants. A\\r\\nsuccession of navigable waters forms a kind of chain round its borders,\\r\\nas if to bind it together; while the most noble rivers in the world,\\r\\nrunning at convenient distances, present them with highways for the\\r\\neasy communication of friendly aids, and the mutual transportation and\\r\\nexchange of their various commodities.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith equal pleasure I have as often taken notice that Providence has\\r\\nbeen pleased to give this one connected country to one united people--a\\r\\npeople descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language,\\r\\nprofessing the same religion, attached to the same principles of\\r\\ngovernment, very similar in their manners and customs, and who, by their\\r\\njoint counsels, arms, and efforts, fighting side by side throughout\\r\\na long and bloody war, have nobly established general liberty and\\r\\nindependence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis country and this people seem to have been made for each other, and\\r\\nit appears as if it was the design of Providence, that an inheritance\\r\\nso proper and convenient for a band of brethren, united to each other\\r\\nby the strongest ties, should never be split into a number of unsocial,\\r\\njealous, and alien sovereignties.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilar sentiments have hitherto prevailed among all orders and\\r\\ndenominations of men among us. To all general purposes we have uniformly\\r\\nbeen one people each individual citizen everywhere enjoying the same\\r\\nnational rights, privileges, and protection. As a nation we have made\\r\\npeace and war; as a nation we have vanquished our common enemies; as\\r\\na nation we have formed alliances, and made treaties, and entered into\\r\\nvarious compacts and conventions with foreign states.\\r\\n\\r\\nA strong sense of the value and blessings of union induced the people,\\r\\nat a very early period, to institute a federal government to preserve\\r\\nand perpetuate it. They formed it almost as soon as they had a political\\r\\nexistence; nay, at a time when their habitations were in flames, when\\r\\nmany of their citizens were bleeding, and when the progress of hostility\\r\\nand desolation left little room for those calm and mature inquiries\\r\\nand reflections which must ever precede the formation of a wise and\\r\\nwell-balanced government for a free people. It is not to be wondered\\r\\nat, that a government instituted in times so inauspicious, should on\\r\\nexperiment be found greatly deficient and inadequate to the purpose it\\r\\nwas intended to answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis intelligent people perceived and regretted these defects. Still\\r\\ncontinuing no less attached to union than enamored of liberty, they\\r\\nobserved the danger which immediately threatened the former and more\\r\\nremotely the latter; and being persuaded that ample security for both\\r\\ncould only be found in a national government more wisely framed, they\\r\\nas with one voice, convened the late convention at Philadelphia, to take\\r\\nthat important subject under consideration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis convention composed of men who possessed the confidence of the\\r\\npeople, and many of whom had become highly distinguished by their\\r\\npatriotism, virtue and wisdom, in times which tried the minds and hearts\\r\\nof men, undertook the arduous task. In the mild season of peace, with\\r\\nminds unoccupied by other subjects, they passed many months in cool,\\r\\nuninterrupted, and daily consultation; and finally, without having\\r\\nbeen awed by power, or influenced by any passions except love for their\\r\\ncountry, they presented and recommended to the people the plan produced\\r\\nby their joint and very unanimous councils.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmit, for so is the fact, that this plan is only RECOMMENDED, not\\r\\nimposed, yet let it be remembered that it is neither recommended to\\r\\nBLIND approbation, nor to BLIND reprobation; but to that sedate and\\r\\ncandid consideration which the magnitude and importance of the subject\\r\\ndemand, and which it certainly ought to receive. But this (as was\\r\\nremarked in the foregoing number of this paper) is more to be wished\\r\\nthan expected, that it may be so considered and examined. Experience on\\r\\na former occasion teaches us not to be too sanguine in such hopes. It\\r\\nis not yet forgotten that well-grounded apprehensions of imminent danger\\r\\ninduced the people of America to form the memorable Congress of 1774.\\r\\nThat body recommended certain measures to their constituents, and the\\r\\nevent proved their wisdom; yet it is fresh in our memories how soon the\\r\\npress began to teem with pamphlets and weekly papers against those very\\r\\nmeasures. Not only many of the officers of government, who obeyed the\\r\\ndictates of personal interest, but others, from a mistaken estimate of\\r\\nconsequences, or the undue influence of former attachments, or whose\\r\\nambition aimed at objects which did not correspond with the public good,\\r\\nwere indefatigable in their efforts to persuade the people to reject\\r\\nthe advice of that patriotic Congress. Many, indeed, were deceived\\r\\nand deluded, but the great majority of the people reasoned and decided\\r\\njudiciously; and happy they are in reflecting that they did so.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey considered that the Congress was composed of many wise and\\r\\nexperienced men. That, being convened from different parts of the\\r\\ncountry, they brought with them and communicated to each other a variety\\r\\nof useful information. That, in the course of the time they passed\\r\\ntogether in inquiring into and discussing the true interests of their\\r\\ncountry, they must have acquired very accurate knowledge on that\\r\\nhead. That they were individually interested in the public liberty and\\r\\nprosperity, and therefore that it was not less their inclination than\\r\\ntheir duty to recommend only such measures as, after the most mature\\r\\ndeliberation, they really thought prudent and advisable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese and similar considerations then induced the people to rely greatly\\r\\non the judgment and integrity of the Congress; and they took their\\r\\nadvice, notwithstanding the various arts and endeavors used to deter\\r\\nthem from it. But if the people at large had reason to confide in the\\r\\nmen of that Congress, few of whom had been fully tried or generally\\r\\nknown, still greater reason have they now to respect the judgment and\\r\\nadvice of the convention, for it is well known that some of the most\\r\\ndistinguished members of that Congress, who have been since tried and\\r\\njustly approved for patriotism and abilities, and who have grown old in\\r\\nacquiring political information, were also members of this convention,\\r\\nand carried into it their accumulated knowledge and experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is worthy of remark that not only the first, but every succeeding\\r\\nCongress, as well as the late convention, have invariably joined with\\r\\nthe people in thinking that the prosperity of America depended on its\\r\\nUnion. To preserve and perpetuate it was the great object of the people\\r\\nin forming that convention, and it is also the great object of the plan\\r\\nwhich the convention has advised them to adopt. With what propriety,\\r\\ntherefore, or for what good purposes, are attempts at this particular\\r\\nperiod made by some men to depreciate the importance of the Union? Or\\r\\nwhy is it suggested that three or four confederacies would be better\\r\\nthan one? I am persuaded in my own mind that the people have always\\r\\nthought right on this subject, and that their universal and uniform\\r\\nattachment to the cause of the Union rests on great and weighty reasons,\\r\\nwhich I shall endeavor to develop and explain in some ensuing papers.\\r\\nThey who promote the idea of substituting a number of distinct\\r\\nconfederacies in the room of the plan of the convention, seem clearly to\\r\\nforesee that the rejection of it would put the continuance of the\\r\\nUnion in the utmost jeopardy. That certainly would be the case, and I\\r\\nsincerely wish that it may be as clearly foreseen by every good citizen,\\r\\nthat whenever the dissolution of the Union arrives, America will have\\r\\nreason to exclaim, in the words of the poet: \\\"FAREWELL! A LONG FAREWELL\\r\\nTO ALL MY GREATNESS.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPUBLIUS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\", \"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Same Subject Continued (Concerning Dangers From Foreign Force and\\r\\nInfluence)\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the Independent Journal. Saturday, November 3, 1787\\r\\n\\r\\nJAY\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\r\\n\\r\\nIT IS not a new observation that the people of any country (if, like\\r\\nthe Americans, intelligent and wellinformed) seldom adopt and steadily\\r\\npersevere for many years in an erroneous opinion respecting their\\r\\ninterests. That consideration naturally tends to create great respect\\r\\nfor the high opinion which the people of America have so long and\\r\\nuniformly entertained of the importance of their continuing firmly\\r\\nunited under one federal government, vested with sufficient powers for\\r\\nall general and national purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe more attentively I consider and investigate the reasons which appear\\r\\nto have given birth to this opinion, the more I become convinced that\\r\\nthey are cogent and conclusive.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the many objects to which a wise and free people find it necessary\\r\\nto direct their attention, that of providing for their SAFETY seems to\\r\\nbe the first. The SAFETY of the people doubtless has relation to a great\\r\\nvariety of circumstances and considerations, and consequently\\r\\naffords great latitude to those who wish to define it precisely and\\r\\ncomprehensively.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt present I mean only to consider it as it respects security for the\\r\\npreservation of peace and tranquillity, as well as against dangers from\\r\\nFOREIGN ARMS AND INFLUENCE, as from dangers of the LIKE KIND arising\\r\\nfrom domestic causes. As the former of these comes first in order, it\\r\\nis proper it should be the first discussed. Let us therefore proceed to\\r\\nexamine whether the people are not right in their opinion that a cordial\\r\\nUnion, under an efficient national government, affords them the best\\r\\nsecurity that can be devised against HOSTILITIES from abroad.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of wars which have happened or will happen in the world will\\r\\nalways be found to be in proportion to the number and weight of the\\r\\ncauses, whether REAL or PRETENDED, which PROVOKE or INVITE them. If this\\r\\nremark be just, it becomes useful to inquire whether so many JUST causes\\r\\nof war are likely to be given by UNITED AMERICA as by DISUNITED America;\\r\\nfor if it should turn out that United America will probably give the\\r\\nfewest, then it will follow that in this respect the Union tends most to\\r\\npreserve the people in a state of peace with other nations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe JUST causes of war, for the most part, arise either from violation\\r\\nof treaties or from direct violence. America has already formed treaties\\r\\nwith no less than six foreign nations, and all of them, except Prussia,\\r\\nare maritime, and therefore able to annoy and injure us. She has also\\r\\nextensive commerce with Portugal, Spain, and Britain, and, with respect\\r\\nto the two latter, has, in addition, the circumstance of neighborhood to\\r\\nattend to.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is of high importance to the peace of America that she observe the\\r\\nlaws of nations towards all these powers, and to me it appears evident\\r\\nthat this will be more perfectly and punctually done by one national\\r\\ngovernment than it could be either by thirteen separate States or by\\r\\nthree or four distinct confederacies.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause when once an efficient national government is established, the\\r\\nbest men in the country will not only consent to serve, but also will\\r\\ngenerally be appointed to manage it; for, although town or country,\\r\\nor other contracted influence, may place men in State assemblies,\\r\\nor senates, or courts of justice, or executive departments, yet more\\r\\ngeneral and extensive reputation for talents and other qualifications\\r\\nwill be necessary to recommend men to offices under the national\\r\\ngovernment,--especially as it will have the widest field for choice, and\\r\\nnever experience that want of proper persons which is not uncommon in\\r\\nsome of the States. Hence, it will result that the administration,\\r\\nthe political counsels, and the judicial decisions of the national\\r\\ngovernment will be more wise, systematical, and judicious than those of\\r\\nindividual States, and consequently more satisfactory with respect to\\r\\nother nations, as well as more SAFE with respect to us.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause, under the national government, treaties and articles of\\r\\ntreaties, as well as the laws of nations, will always be expounded in\\r\\none sense and executed in the same manner,--whereas, adjudications on\\r\\nthe same points and questions, in thirteen States, or in three or four\\r\\nconfederacies, will not always accord or be consistent; and that, as\\r\\nwell from the variety of independent courts and judges appointed by\\r\\ndifferent and independent governments, as from the different local laws\\r\\nand interests which may affect and influence them. The wisdom of\\r\\nthe convention, in committing such questions to the jurisdiction and\\r\\njudgment of courts appointed by and responsible only to one national\\r\\ngovernment, cannot be too much commended.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the prospect of present loss or advantage may often tempt the\\r\\ngoverning party in one or two States to swerve from good faith and\\r\\njustice; but those temptations, not reaching the other States, and\\r\\nconsequently having little or no influence on the national government,\\r\\nthe temptation will be fruitless, and good faith and justice be\\r\\npreserved. The case of the treaty of peace with Britain adds great\\r\\nweight to this reasoning.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause, even if the governing party in a State should be disposed to\\r\\nresist such temptations, yet as such temptations may, and commonly do,\\r\\nresult from circumstances peculiar to the State, and may affect a great\\r\\nnumber of the inhabitants, the governing party may not always be\\r\\nable, if willing, to prevent the injustice meditated, or to punish the\\r\\naggressors. But the national government, not being affected by those\\r\\nlocal circumstances, will neither be induced to commit the wrong\\r\\nthemselves, nor want power or inclination to prevent or punish its\\r\\ncommission by others.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far, therefore, as either designed or accidental violations of\\r\\ntreaties and the laws of nations afford JUST causes of war, they are\\r\\nless to be apprehended under one general government than under several\\r\\nlesser ones, and in that respect the former most favors the SAFETY of\\r\\nthe people.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to those just causes of war which proceed from direct and unlawful\\r\\nviolence, it appears equally clear to me that one good national\\r\\ngovernment affords vastly more security against dangers of that sort\\r\\nthan can be derived from any other quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause such violences are more frequently caused by the passions and\\r\\ninterests of a part than of the whole; of one or two States than of the\\r\\nUnion. Not a single Indian war has yet been occasioned by aggressions of\\r\\nthe present federal government, feeble as it is; but there are several\\r\\ninstances of Indian hostilities having been provoked by the improper\\r\\nconduct of individual States, who, either unable or unwilling to\\r\\nrestrain or punish offenses, have given occasion to the slaughter of\\r\\nmany innocent inhabitants.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood of Spanish and British territories, bordering on some\\r\\nStates and not on others, naturally confines the causes of quarrel more\\r\\nimmediately to the borderers. The bordering States, if any, will be\\r\\nthose who, under the impulse of sudden irritation, and a quick sense of\\r\\napparent interest or injury, will be most likely, by direct violence,\\r\\nto excite war with these nations; and nothing can so effectually obviate\\r\\nthat danger as a national government, whose wisdom and prudence will\\r\\nnot be diminished by the passions which actuate the parties immediately\\r\\ninterested.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut not only fewer just causes of war will be given by the national\\r\\ngovernment, but it will also be more in their power to accommodate and\\r\\nsettle them amicably. They will be more temperate and cool, and in that\\r\\nrespect, as well as in others, will be more in capacity to act advisedly\\r\\nthan the offending State. The pride of states, as well as of men,\\r\\nnaturally disposes them to justify all their actions, and opposes their\\r\\nacknowledging, correcting, or repairing their errors and offenses. The\\r\\nnational government, in such cases, will not be affected by this pride,\\r\\nbut will proceed with moderation and candor to consider and decide on\\r\\nthe means most proper to extricate them from the difficulties which\\r\\nthreaten them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides, it is well known that acknowledgments, explanations, and\\r\\ncompensations are often accepted as satisfactory from a strong united\\r\\nnation, which would be rejected as unsatisfactory if offered by a State\\r\\nor confederacy of little consideration or power.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the year 1685, the state of Genoa having offended Louis,\\r\\nendeavored to appease him. He demanded that they should send their Doge,\\r\\nor chief magistrate, accompanied by four of their senators, to FRANCE,\\r\\nto ask his pardon and receive his terms.

Wednesday, November 7, 1787\\r\\n\\r\\nJAY\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\r\\n\\r\\nMY LAST paper assigned several reasons why the safety of the people\\r\\nwould be best secured by union against the danger it may be exposed to\\r\\nby JUST causes of war given to other nations; and those reasons show\\r\\nthat such causes would not only be more rarely given, but would also be\\r\\nmore easily accommodated, by a national government than either by the\\r\\nState governments or the proposed little confederacies.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the safety of the people of America against dangers from FOREIGN\\r\\nforce depends not only on their forbearing to give JUST causes of war\\r\\nto other nations, but also on their placing and continuing themselves in\\r\\nsuch a situation as not to INVITE hostility or insult; for it need not\\r\\nbe observed that there are PRETENDED as well as just causes of war.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is too true, however disgraceful it may be to human nature, that\\r\\nnations in general will make war whenever they have a prospect of\\r\\ngetting anything by it; nay, absolute monarchs will often make war when\\r\\ntheir nations are to get nothing by it, but for the purposes and objects\\r\\nmerely personal, such as thirst for military glory, revenge for personal\\r\\naffronts, ambition, or private compacts to aggrandize or support their\\r\\nparticular families or partisans. These and a variety of other motives,\\r\\nwhich affect only the mind of the sovereign, often lead him to engage in\\r\\nwars not sanctified by justice or the voice and interests of his people.\\r\\nBut, independent of these inducements to war, which are more prevalent\\r\\nin absolute monarchies, but which well deserve our attention, there are\\r\\nothers which affect nations as often as kings; and some of them will\\r\\non examination be found to grow out of our relative situation and\\r\\ncircumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith France and with Britain we are rivals in the fisheries, and can\\r\\nsupply their markets cheaper than they can themselves, notwithstanding\\r\\nany efforts to prevent it by bounties on their own or duties on foreign\\r\\nfish.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith them and with most other European nations we are rivals in\\r\\nnavigation and the carrying trade; and we shall deceive ourselves if we\\r\\nsuppose that any of them will rejoice to see it flourish; for, as\\r\\nour carrying trade cannot increase without in some degree diminishing\\r\\ntheirs, it is more their interest, and will be more their policy, to\\r\\nrestrain than to promote it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the trade to China and India, we interfere with more than one nation,\\r\\ninasmuch as it enables us to partake in advantages which they had in a\\r\\nmanner monopolized, and as we thereby supply ourselves with commodities\\r\\nwhich we used to purchase from them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe extension of our own commerce in our own vessels cannot give\\r\\npleasure to any nations who possess territories on or near this\\r\\ncontinent, because the cheapness and excellence of our productions,\\r\\nadded to the circumstance of vicinity, and the enterprise and address\\r\\nof our merchants and navigators, will give us a greater share in the\\r\\nadvantages which those territories afford, than consists with the wishes\\r\\nor policy of their respective sovereigns.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpain thinks it convenient to shut the Mississippi against us on the one\\r\\nside, and Britain excludes us from the Saint Lawrence on the other; nor\\r\\nwill either of them permit the other waters which are between them and\\r\\nus to become the means of mutual intercourse and traffic.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom these and such like considerations, which might, if consistent\\r\\nwith prudence, be more amplified and detailed, it is easy to see that\\r\\njealousies and uneasinesses may gradually slide into the minds and\\r\\ncabinets of other nations, and that we are not to expect that they\\r\\nshould regard our advancement in union, in power and consequence by land\\r\\nand by sea, with an eye of indifference and composure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe people of America are aware that inducements to war may arise out of\\r\\nthese circumstances, as well as from others not so obvious at present,\\r\\nand that whenever such inducements may find fit time and opportunity\\r\\nfor operation, pretenses to color and justify them will not be wanting.\\r\\nWisely, therefore, do they consider union and a good national government\\r\\nas necessary to put and keep them in SUCH A SITUATION as, instead of\\r\\nINVITING war, will tend to repress and discourage it. That situation\\r\\nconsists in the best possible state of defense, and necessarily depends\\r\\non the government, the arms, and the resources of the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the safety of the whole is the interest of the whole, and cannot\\r\\nbe provided for without government, either one or more or many, let us\\r\\ninquire whether one good government is not, relative to the object in\\r\\nquestion, more competent than any other given number whatever.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne government can collect and avail itself of the talents and\\r\\nexperience of the ablest men, in whatever part of the Union they may be\\r\\nfound. It can move on uniform principles of policy. It can harmonize,\\r\\nassimilate, and protect the several parts and members, and extend the\\r\\nbenefit of its foresight and precautions to each. In the formation of\\r\\ntreaties, it will regard the interest of the whole, and the particular\\r\\ninterests of the parts as connected with that of the whole. It can apply\\r\\nthe resources and power of the whole to the defense of any particular\\r\\npart, and that more easily and expeditiously than State governments or\\r\\nseparate confederacies can possibly do, for want of concert and unity of\\r\\nsystem. It can place the militia under one plan of discipline, and, by\\r\\nputting their officers in a proper line of subordination to the Chief\\r\\nMagistrate, will, as it were, consolidate them into one corps, and\\r\\nthereby render them more efficient than if divided into thirteen or into\\r\\nthree or four distinct independent companies.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat would the militia of Britain be if the English militia obeyed the\\r\\ngovernment of England, if the Scotch militia obeyed the government\\r\\nof Scotland, and if the Welsh militia obeyed the government of Wales?\\r\\nSuppose an invasion; would those three governments (if they agreed at\\r\\nall) be able, with all their respective forces, to operate against the\\r\\nenemy so effectually as the single government of Great Britain would?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have heard much of the fleets of Britain, and the time may come, if\\r\\nwe are wise, when the fleets of America may engage attention. But if one\\r\\nnational government, had not so regulated the navigation of Britain\\r\\nas to make it a nursery for seamen--if one national government had not\\r\\ncalled forth all the national means and materials for forming fleets,\\r\\ntheir prowess and their thunder would never have been celebrated. Let\\r\\nEngland have its navigation and fleet--let Scotland have its navigation\\r\\nand fleet--let Wales have its navigation and fleet--let Ireland have\\r\\nits navigation and fleet--let those four of the constituent parts of the\\r\\nBritish empire be under four independent governments, and it is\\r\\neasy to perceive how soon they would each dwindle into comparative\\r\\ninsignificance.\\r\\n\\r\\nApply these facts to our own case. Leave America divided into thirteen\\r\\nor, if you please, into three or four independent governments--what\\r\\narmies could they raise and pay--what fleets could they ever hope to\\r\\nhave? If one was attacked, would the others fly to its succor, and spend\\r\\ntheir blood and money in its defense? Would there be no danger of their\\r\\nbeing flattered into neutrality by its specious promises, or seduced by\\r\\na too great fondness for peace to decline hazarding their tranquillity\\r\\nand present safety for the sake of neighbors, of whom perhaps they have\\r\\nbeen jealous, and whose importance they are content to see diminished?\\r\\nAlthough such conduct would not be wise, it would, nevertheless, be\\r\\nnatural. The history of the states of Greece, and of other countries,\\r\\nabounds with such instances, and it is not improbable that what has so\\r\\noften happened would, under similar circumstances, happen again.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut admit that they might be willing to help the invaded State or\\r\\nconfederacy. How, and when, and in what proportion shall aids of men and\\r\\nmoney be afforded? Who shall command the allied armies, and from which\\r\\nof them shall he receive his orders? Who shall settle the terms of\\r\\npeace, and in case of disputes what umpire shall decide between them and\\r\\ncompel acquiescence? Various difficulties and inconveniences would be\\r\\ninseparable from such a situation; whereas one government, watching over\\r\\nthe general and common interests, and combining and directing the powers\\r\\nand resources of the whole, would be free from all these embarrassments,\\r\\nand conduce far more to the safety of the people.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut whatever may be our situation, whether firmly united under one\\r\\nnational government, or split into a number of confederacies, certain\\r\\nit is, that foreign nations will know and view it exactly as it is;\\r\\nand they will act toward us accordingly. If they see that our national\\r\\ngovernment is efficient and well administered, our trade prudently\\r\\nregulated, our militia properly organized and disciplined, our resources\\r\\nand finances discreetly managed, our credit re-established, our\\r\\npeople free, contented, and united, they will be much more disposed to\\r\\ncultivate our friendship than provoke our resentment. If, on the other\\r\\nhand, they find us either destitute of an effectual government (each\\r\\nState doing right or wrong, as to its rulers may seem convenient), or\\r\\nsplit into three or four independent and probably discordant republics\\r\\nor confederacies, one inclining to Britain, another to France, and a\\r\\nthird to Spain, and perhaps played off against each other by the three,\\r\\nwhat a poor, pitiful figure will America make in their eyes! How liable\\r\\nwould she become not only to their contempt but to their outrage, and\\r\\nhow soon would dear-bought experience proclaim that when a people or\\r\\nfamily so divide, it never fails to be against themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nPUBLIUS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\", \"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Same Subject Continued (Concerning Dangers From Foreign Force and\\r\\nInfluence)\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the Independent Journal. Saturday, November 10, 1787\\r\\n\\r\\nJAY\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\r\\n\\r\\nQUEEN ANNE, in her letter of the 1st July, 1706, to the Scotch\\r\\nParliament, makes some observations on the importance of the UNION then\\r\\nforming between England and Scotland, which merit our attention. I shall\\r\\npresent the public with one or two extracts from it: \\\"An entire and\\r\\nperfect union will be the solid foundation of lasting peace: It will\\r\\nsecure your religion, liberty, and property; remove the animosities\\r\\namongst yourselves, and the jealousies and differences betwixt our two\\r\\nkingdoms. It must increase your strength, riches, and trade; and by\\r\\nthis union the whole island, being joined in affection and free from all\\r\\napprehensions of different interest, will be ENABLED TO RESIST ALL ITS\\r\\nENEMIES.\\\" \\\"We most earnestly recommend to you calmness and unanimity in\\r\\nthis great and weighty affair, that the union may be brought to a happy\\r\\nconclusion, being the only EFFECTUAL way to secure our present and\\r\\nfuture happiness, and disappoint the designs of our and your enemies,\\r\\nwho will doubtless, on this occasion, USE THEIR UTMOST ENDEAVORS TO\\r\\nPREVENT OR DELAY THIS UNION.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was remarked in the preceding paper, that weakness and divisions at\\r\\nhome would invite dangers from abroad; and that nothing would tend more\\r\\nto secure us from them than union, strength, and good government within\\r\\nourselves. This subject is copious and cannot easily be exhausted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe history of Great Britain is the one with which we are in general the\\r\\nbest acquainted, and it gives us many useful lessons. We may profit by\\r\\ntheir experience without paying the price which it cost them. Although\\r\\nit seems obvious to common sense that the people of such an island\\r\\nshould be but one nation, yet we find that they were for ages divided\\r\\ninto three, and that those three were almost constantly embroiled in\\r\\nquarrels and wars with one another. Notwithstanding their true interest\\r\\nwith respect to the continental nations was really the same, yet by the\\r\\narts and policy and practices of those nations, their mutual jealousies\\r\\nwere perpetually kept inflamed, and for a long series of years they\\r\\nwere far more inconvenient and troublesome than they were useful and\\r\\nassisting to each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould the people of America divide themselves into three or four\\r\\nnations, would not the same thing happen? Would not similar jealousies\\r\\narise, and be in like manner cherished? Instead of their being \\\"joined\\r\\nin affection\\\" and free from all apprehension of different \\\"interests,\\\"\\r\\nenvy and jealousy would soon extinguish confidence and affection,\\r\\nand the partial interests of each confederacy, instead of the general\\r\\ninterests of all America, would be the only objects of their policy and\\r\\npursuits. Hence, like most other BORDERING nations, they would always\\r\\nbe either involved in disputes and war, or live in the constant\\r\\napprehension of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most sanguine advocates for three or four confederacies cannot\\r\\nreasonably suppose that they would long remain exactly on an equal\\r\\nfooting in point of strength, even if it was possible to form them so at\\r\\nfirst; but, admitting that to be practicable, yet what human contrivance\\r\\ncan secure the continuance of such equality? Independent of those local\\r\\ncircumstances which tend to beget and increase power in one part and to\\r\\nimpede its progress in another, we must advert to the effects of that\\r\\nsuperior policy and good management which would probably distinguish the\\r\\ngovernment of one above the rest, and by which their relative equality\\r\\nin strength and consideration would be destroyed. For it cannot be\\r\\npresumed that the same degree of sound policy, prudence, and foresight\\r\\nwould uniformly be observed by each of these confederacies for a long\\r\\nsuccession of years.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhenever, and from whatever causes, it might happen, and happen it\\r\\nwould, that any one of these nations or confederacies should rise on the\\r\\nscale of political importance much above the degree of her neighbors,\\r\\nthat moment would those neighbors behold her with envy and with fear.\\r\\nBoth those passions would lead them to countenance, if not to promote,\\r\\nwhatever might promise to diminish her importance; and would also\\r\\nrestrain them from measures calculated to advance or even to secure her\\r\\nprosperity. Much time would not be necessary to enable her to discern\\r\\nthese unfriendly dispositions. She would soon begin, not only to lose\\r\\nconfidence in her neighbors, but also to feel a disposition equally\\r\\nunfavorable to them. Distrust naturally creates distrust, and by nothing\\r\\nis good-will and kind conduct more speedily changed than by invidious\\r\\njealousies and uncandid imputations, whether expressed or implied.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe North is generally the region of strength, and many local\\r\\ncircumstances render it probable that the most Northern of the proposed\\r\\nconfederacies would, at a period not very distant, be unquestionably\\r\\nmore formidable than any of the others. No sooner would this become\\r\\nevident than the NORTHERN HIVE would excite the same ideas and\\r\\nsensations in the more southern parts of America which it formerly\\r\\ndid in the southern parts of Europe. Nor does it appear to be a rash\\r\\nconjecture that its young swarms might often be tempted to gather honey\\r\\nin the more blooming fields and milder air of their luxurious and more\\r\\ndelicate neighbors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey who well consider the history of similar divisions and\\r\\nconfederacies will find abundant reason to apprehend that those in\\r\\ncontemplation would in no other sense be neighbors than as they would\\r\\nbe borderers; that they would neither love nor trust one another, but on\\r\\nthe contrary would be a prey to discord, jealousy, and mutual injuries;\\r\\nin short, that they would place us exactly in the situations in which\\r\\nsome nations doubtless wish to see us, viz., FORMIDABLE ONLY TO EACH\\r\\nOTHER.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom these considerations it appears that those gentlemen are greatly\\r\\nmistaken who suppose that alliances offensive and defensive might be\\r\\nformed between these confederacies, and would produce that combination\\r\\nand union of wills of arms and of resources, which would be necessary\\r\\nto put and keep them in a formidable state of defense against foreign\\r\\nenemies.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen did the independent states, into which Britain and Spain were\\r\\nformerly divided, combine in such alliance, or unite their forces\\r\\nagainst a foreign enemy? The proposed confederacies will be DISTINCT\\r\\nNATIONS. Each of them would have its commerce with foreigners to\\r\\nregulate by distinct treaties; and as their productions and commodities\\r\\nare different and proper for different markets, so would those treaties\\r\\nbe essentially different. Different commercial concerns must create\\r\\ndifferent interests, and of course different degrees of political\\r\\nattachment to and connection with different foreign nations. Hence it\\r\\nmight and probably would happen that the foreign nation with whom the\\r\\nSOUTHERN confederacy might be at war would be the one with whom the\\r\\nNORTHERN confederacy would be the most desirous of preserving peace and\\r\\nfriendship. An alliance so contrary to their immediate interest would\\r\\nnot therefore be easy to form, nor, if formed, would it be observed and\\r\\nfulfilled with perfect good faith.\\r\\n\\r\\nNay, it is far more probable that in America, as in Europe, neighboring\\r\\nnations, acting under the impulse of opposite interests and unfriendly\\r\\npassions, would frequently be found taking different sides. Considering\\r\\nour distance from Europe, it would be more natural for these\\r\\nconfederacies to apprehend danger from one another than from distant\\r\\nnations, and therefore that each of them should be more desirous to\\r\\nguard against the others by the aid of foreign alliances, than to guard\\r\\nagainst foreign dangers by alliances between themselves. And here let us\\r\\nnot forget how much more easy it is to receive foreign fleets into our\\r\\nports, and foreign armies into our country, than it is to persuade or\\r\\ncompel them to depart. How many conquests did the Romans and others make\\r\\nin the characters of allies, and what innovations did they under\\r\\nthe same character introduce into the governments of those whom they\\r\\npretended to protect.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet candid men judge, then, whether the division of America into any\\r\\ngiven number of independent sovereignties would tend to secure us\\r\\nagainst the hostilities and improper interference of foreign nations.\\r\\n\\r\\nPUBLIUS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\", \"\\r\\n\\r\\nConcerning Dangers from Dissensions Between the States\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the Independent Journal. Wednesday, November 14, 1787\\r\\n\\r\\nHAMILTON\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE three last numbers of this paper have been dedicated to an\\r\\nenumeration of the dangers to which we should be exposed, in a state of\\r\\ndisunion, from the arms and arts of foreign nations. I shall now proceed\\r\\nto delineate dangers of a different and, perhaps, still more alarming\\r\\nkind--those which will in all probability flow from dissensions between\\r\\nthe States themselves, and from domestic factions and convulsions.\\r\\nThese have been already in some instances slightly anticipated; but they\\r\\ndeserve a more particular and more full investigation.\\r\\n\\r\\nA man must be far gone in Utopian speculations who can seriously doubt\\r\\nthat, if these States should either be wholly disunited, or only united\\r\\nin partial confederacies, the subdivisions into which they might be\\r\\nthrown would have frequent and violent contests with each other. To\\r\\npresume a want of motives for such contests as an argument against their\\r\\nexistence, would be to forget that men are ambitious, vindictive, and\\r\\nrapacious. To look for a continuation of harmony between a number of\\r\\nindependent, unconnected sovereignties in the same neighborhood, would\\r\\nbe to disregard the uniform course of human events, and to set at\\r\\ndefiance the accumulated experience of ages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe causes of hostility among nations are innumerable. There are some\\r\\nwhich have a general and almost constant operation upon the collective\\r\\nbodies of society. Of this description are the love of power or the\\r\\ndesire of pre-eminence and dominion--the jealousy of power, or the\\r\\ndesire of equality and safety. There are others which have a more\\r\\ncircumscribed though an equally operative influence within their\\r\\nspheres. Such are the rivalships and competitions of commerce between\\r\\ncommercial nations. And there are others, not less numerous than either\\r\\nof the former, which take their origin entirely in private passions;\\r\\nin the attachments, enmities, interests, hopes, and fears of leading\\r\\nindividuals in the communities of which they are members. Men of this\\r\\nclass, whether the favorites of a king or of a people, have in too many\\r\\ninstances abused the confidence they possessed; and assuming the pretext\\r\\nof some public motive, have not scrupled to sacrifice the national\\r\\ntranquillity to personal advantage or personal gratification.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe celebrated Pericles, in compliance with the resentment of a\\r\\nprostitute,(1) at the expense of much of the blood and treasure of\\r\\nhis countrymen, attacked, vanquished, and destroyed the city of\\r\\nthe SAMMIANS. The same man, stimulated by private pique against the\\r\\nMEGARENSIANS,(2) another nation of Greece, or to avoid a prosecution\\r\\nwith which he was threatened as an accomplice of a supposed theft of\\r\\nthe statuary Phidias,(3) or to get rid of the accusations prepared to\\r\\nbe brought against him for dissipating the funds of the state in the\\r\\npurchase of popularity,(4) or from a combination of all these causes,\\r\\nwas the primitive author of that famous and fatal war, distinguished in\\r\\nthe Grecian annals by the name of the PELOPONNESIAN war; which, after\\r\\nvarious vicissitudes, intermissions, and renewals, terminated in the\\r\\nruin of the Athenian commonwealth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ambitious cardinal, who was prime minister to Henry VIII.,\\r\\npermitting his vanity to aspire to the triple crown,(5) entertained\\r\\nhopes of succeeding in the acquisition of that splendid prize by the\\r\\ninfluence of the Emperor Charles V. To secure the favor and interest of\\r\\nthis enterprising and powerful monarch, he precipitated England into a\\r\\nwar with France, contrary to the plainest dictates of policy, and at the\\r\\nhazard of the safety and independence, as well of the kingdom over which\\r\\nhe presided by his counsels, as of Europe in general. For if there\\r\\never was a sovereign who bid fair to realize the project of universal\\r\\nmonarchy, it was the Emperor Charles V., of whose intrigues Wolsey was\\r\\nat once the instrument and the dupe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe influence which the bigotry of one female,(6) the petulance of\\r\\nanother,(7) and the cabals of a third,(8) had in the contemporary\\r\\npolicy, ferments, and pacifications, of a considerable part of Europe,\\r\\nare topics that have been too often descanted upon not to be generally\\r\\nknown.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo multiply examples of the agency of personal considerations in\\r\\nthe production of great national events, either foreign or domestic,\\r\\naccording to their direction, would be an unnecessary waste of time.\\r\\nThose who have but a superficial acquaintance with the sources from\\r\\nwhich they are to be drawn, will themselves recollect a variety of\\r\\ninstances; and those who have a tolerable knowledge of human nature will\\r\\nnot stand in need of such lights to form their opinion either of the\\r\\nreality or extent of that agency. Perhaps, however, a reference, tending\\r\\nto illustrate the general principle, may with propriety be made to a\\r\\ncase which has lately happened among ourselves. If Shays had not been a\\r\\nDESPERATE DEBTOR, it is much to be doubted whether Massachusetts would\\r\\nhave been plunged into a civil war.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut notwithstanding the concurring testimony of experience, in this\\r\\nparticular, there are still to be found visionary or designing men,\\r\\nwho stand ready to advocate the paradox of perpetual peace between the\\r\\nStates, though dismembered and alienated from each other. The genius of\\r\\nrepublics (say they) is pacific; the spirit of commerce has a tendency\\r\\nto soften the manners of men, and to extinguish those inflammable humors\\r\\nwhich have so often kindled into wars. Commercial republics, like ours,\\r\\nwill never be disposed to waste themselves in ruinous contentions with\\r\\neach other. They will be governed by mutual interest, and will cultivate\\r\\na spirit of mutual amity and concord.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it not (we may ask these projectors in politics) the true interest of\\r\\nall nations to cultivate the same benevolent and philosophic spirit? If\\r\\nthis be their true interest, have they in fact pursued it? Has it not,\\r\\non the contrary, invariably been found that momentary passions, and\\r\\nimmediate interest, have a more active and imperious control over human\\r\\nconduct than general or remote considerations of policy, utility or\\r\\njustice? Have republics in practice been less addicted to war than\\r\\nmonarchies? Are not the former administered by MEN as well as the\\r\\nlatter? Are there not aversions, predilections, rivalships, and desires\\r\\nof unjust acquisitions, that affect nations as well as kings? Are\\r\\nnot popular assemblies frequently subject to the impulses of rage,\\r\\nresentment, jealousy, avarice, and of other irregular and violent\\r\\npropensities? Is it not well known that their determinations are often\\r\\ngoverned by a few individuals in whom they place confidence, and are,\\r\\nof course, liable to be tinctured by the passions and views of those\\r\\nindividuals? Has commerce hitherto done anything more than change\\r\\nthe objects of war? Is not the love of wealth as domineering and\\r\\nenterprising a passion as that of power or glory? Have there not been\\r\\nas many wars founded upon commercial motives since that has become the\\r\\nprevailing system of nations, as were before occasioned by the cupidity\\r\\nof territory or dominion? Has not the spirit of commerce, in many\\r\\ninstances, administered new incentives to the appetite, both for the\\r\\none and for the other? Let experience, the least fallible guide of human\\r\\nopinions, be appealed to for an answer to these inquiries.\\r\\n\\r\\nSparta, Athens, Rome, and Carthage were all republics; two of them,\\r\\nAthens and Carthage, of the commercial kind. Yet were they as often\\r\\nengaged in wars, offensive and defensive, as the neighboring monarchies\\r\\nof the same times. Sparta was little better than a wellregulated camp;\\r\\nand Rome was never sated of carnage and conquest.\\r\\n\\r\\nCarthage, though a commercial republic, was the aggressor in the very\\r\\nwar that ended in her destruction. Hannibal had carried her arms into\\r\\nthe heart of Italy and to the gates of Rome, before Scipio, in turn,\\r\\ngave him an overthrow in the territories of Carthage, and made a\\r\\nconquest of the commonwealth.\\r\\n\\r\\nVenice, in later times, figured more than once in wars of ambition,\\r\\ntill, becoming an object to the other Italian states, Pope Julius II.\\r\\nfound means to accomplish that formidable league,(9) which gave a deadly\\r\\nblow to the power and pride of this haughty republic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe provinces of Holland, till they were overwhelmed in debts and taxes,\\r\\ntook a leading and conspicuous part in the wars of Europe. They had\\r\\nfurious contests with England for the dominion of the sea, and were\\r\\namong the most persevering and most implacable of the opponents of Louis.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the government of Britain the representatives of the people compose\\r\\none branch of the national legislature. Commerce has been for ages the\\r\\npredominant pursuit of that country. Few nations, nevertheless, have\\r\\nbeen more frequently engaged in war; and the wars in which that kingdom\\r\\nhas been engaged have, in numerous instances, proceeded from the people.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been, if I may so express it, almost as many popular as\\r\\nroyal wars. The cries of the nation and the importunities of their\\r\\nrepresentatives have, upon various occasions, dragged their monarchs\\r\\ninto war, or continued them in it, contrary to their inclinations, and\\r\\nsometimes contrary to the real interests of the State. In that memorable\\r\\nstruggle for superiority between the rival houses of AUSTRIA and\\r\\nBOURBON, which so long kept Europe in a flame, it is well known that the\\r\\nantipathies of the English against the French, seconding the ambition,\\r\\nor rather the avarice, of a favorite leader,(10) protracted the war\\r\\nbeyond the limits marked out by sound policy, and for a considerable\\r\\ntime in opposition to the views of the court.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wars of these two last-mentioned nations have in a great measure\\r\\ngrown out of commercial considerations,--the desire of supplanting and\\r\\nthe fear of being supplanted, either in particular branches of traffic\\r\\nor in the general advantages of trade and navigation, and sometimes even\\r\\nthe more culpable desire of sharing in the commerce of other nations\\r\\nwithout their consent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last war but between Britain and Spain sprang from the attempts of\\r\\nthe British merchants to prosecute an illicit trade with the Spanish\\r\\nmain. These unjustifiable practices on their part produced severity on\\r\\nthe part of the Spaniards toward the subjects of Great Britain which\\r\\nwere not more justifiable, because they exceeded the bounds of a just\\r\\nretaliation and were chargeable with inhumanity and cruelty. Many of\\r\\nthe English who were taken on the Spanish coast were sent to dig in the\\r\\nmines of Potosi; and by the usual progress of a spirit of resentment,\\r\\nthe innocent were, after a while, confounded with the guilty in\\r\\nindiscriminate punishment.

Thursday, November 15, 1787\\r\\n\\r\\nHAMILTON\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\r\\n\\r\\nIT IS sometimes asked, with an air of seeming triumph, what inducements\\r\\ncould the States have, if disunited, to make war upon each other? It\\r\\nwould be a full answer to this question to say--precisely the same\\r\\ninducements which have, at different times, deluged in blood all the\\r\\nnations in the world. But, unfortunately for us, the question admits\\r\\nof a more particular answer. There are causes of differences within\\r\\nour immediate contemplation, of the tendency of which, even under the\\r\\nrestraints of a federal constitution, we have had sufficient experience\\r\\nto enable us to form a judgment of what might be expected if those\\r\\nrestraints were removed.\\r\\n\\r\\nTerritorial disputes have at all times been found one of the most\\r\\nfertile sources of hostility among nations. Perhaps the greatest\\r\\nproportion of wars that have desolated the earth have sprung from this\\r\\norigin. This cause would exist among us in full force. We have a vast\\r\\ntract of unsettled territory within the boundaries of the United States.\\r\\nThere still are discordant and undecided claims between several of them,\\r\\nand the dissolution of the Union would lay a foundation for similar\\r\\nclaims between them all. It is well known that they have heretofore had\\r\\nserious and animated discussion concerning the rights to the lands which\\r\\nwere ungranted at the time of the Revolution, and which usually went\\r\\nunder the name of crown lands. The States within the limits of whose\\r\\ncolonial governments they were comprised have claimed them as their\\r\\nproperty, the others have contended that the rights of the crown in this\\r\\narticle devolved upon the Union; especially as to all that part of the\\r\\nWestern territory which, either by actual possession, or through the\\r\\nsubmission of the Indian proprietors, was subjected to the jurisdiction\\r\\nof the king of Great Britain, till it was relinquished in the treaty of\\r\\npeace. This, it has been said, was at all events an acquisition to the\\r\\nConfederacy by compact with a foreign power. It has been the prudent\\r\\npolicy of Congress to appease this controversy, by prevailing upon the\\r\\nStates to make cessions to the United States for the benefit of the\\r\\nwhole. This has been so far accomplished as, under a continuation of the\\r\\nUnion, to afford a decided prospect of an amicable termination of the\\r\\ndispute. A dismemberment of the Confederacy, however, would revive this\\r\\ndispute, and would create others on the same subject. At present, a\\r\\nlarge part of the vacant Western territory is, by cession at least, if\\r\\nnot by any anterior right, the common property of the Union. If that\\r\\nwere at an end, the States which made the cession, on a principle\\r\\nof federal compromise, would be apt when the motive of the grant had\\r\\nceased, to reclaim the lands as a reversion. The other States would no\\r\\ndoubt insist on a proportion, by right of representation. Their argument\\r\\nwould be, that a grant, once made, could not be revoked; and that the\\r\\njustice of participating in territory acquired or secured by the joint\\r\\nefforts of the Confederacy, remained undiminished. If, contrary to\\r\\nprobability, it should be admitted by all the States, that each had a\\r\\nright to a share of this common stock, there would still be a difficulty\\r\\nto be surmounted, as to a proper rule of apportionment. Different\\r\\nprinciples would be set up by different States for this purpose; and as\\r\\nthey would affect the opposite interests of the parties, they might not\\r\\neasily be susceptible of a pacific adjustment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the wide field of Western territory, therefore, we perceive an ample\\r\\ntheatre for hostile pretensions, without any umpire or common judge to\\r\\ninterpose between the contending parties. To reason from the past to\\r\\nthe future, we shall have good ground to apprehend, that the sword\\r\\nwould sometimes be appealed to as the arbiter of their differences.\\r\\nThe circumstances of the dispute between Connecticut and Pennsylvania,\\r\\nrespecting the land at Wyoming, admonish us not to be sanguine in\\r\\nexpecting an easy accommodation of such differences. The articles of\\r\\nconfederation obliged the parties to submit the matter to the decision\\r\\nof a federal court. The submission was made, and the court decided\\r\\nin favor of Pennsylvania. But Connecticut gave strong indications\\r\\nof dissatisfaction with that determination; nor did she appear to be\\r\\nentirely resigned to it, till, by negotiation and management, something\\r\\nlike an equivalent was found for the loss she supposed herself to have\\r\\nsustained. Nothing here said is intended to convey the slightest censure\\r\\non the conduct of that State. She no doubt sincerely believed herself\\r\\nto have been injured by the decision; and States, like individuals,\\r\\nacquiesce with great reluctance in determinations to their disadvantage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who had an opportunity of seeing the inside of the transactions\\r\\nwhich attended the progress of the controversy between this State and\\r\\nthe district of Vermont, can vouch the opposition we experienced, as\\r\\nwell from States not interested as from those which were interested\\r\\nin the claim; and can attest the danger to which the peace of the\\r\\nConfederacy might have been exposed, had this State attempted to assert\\r\\nits rights by force. Two motives preponderated in that opposition: one,\\r\\na jealousy entertained of our future power; and the other, the interest\\r\\nof certain individuals of influence in the neighboring States, who had\\r\\nobtained grants of lands under the actual government of that district.\\r\\nEven the States which brought forward claims, in contradiction to ours,\\r\\nseemed more solicitous to dismember this State, than to establish\\r\\ntheir own pretensions. These were New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and\\r\\nConnecticut. New Jersey and Rhode Island, upon all occasions, discovered\\r\\na warm zeal for the independence of Vermont; and Maryland, till alarmed\\r\\nby the appearance of a connection between Canada and that State, entered\\r\\ndeeply into the same views. These being small States, saw with an\\r\\nunfriendly eye the perspective of our growing greatness. In a review of\\r\\nthese transactions we may trace some of the causes which would be\\r\\nlikely to embroil the States with each other, if it should be their\\r\\nunpropitious destiny to become disunited.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe competitions of commerce would be another fruitful source of\\r\\ncontention. The States less favorably circumstanced would be desirous\\r\\nof escaping from the disadvantages of local situation, and of sharing\\r\\nin the advantages of their more fortunate neighbors. Each State,\\r\\nor separate confederacy, would pursue a system of commercial policy\\r\\npeculiar to itself. This would occasion distinctions, preferences, and\\r\\nexclusions, which would beget discontent. The habits of intercourse, on\\r\\nthe basis of equal privileges, to which we have been accustomed since\\r\\nthe earliest settlement of the country, would give a keener edge to\\r\\nthose causes of discontent than they would naturally have independent\\r\\nof this circumstance. WE SHOULD BE READY TO DENOMINATE INJURIES THOSE\\r\\nTHINGS WHICH WERE IN REALITY THE JUSTIFIABLE ACTS OF INDEPENDENT\\r\\nSOVEREIGNTIES CONSULTING A DISTINCT INTEREST. The spirit of enterprise,\\r\\nwhich characterizes the commercial part of America, has left no occasion\\r\\nof displaying itself unimproved. It is not at all probable that this\\r\\nunbridled spirit would pay much respect to those regulations of trade by\\r\\nwhich particular States might endeavor to secure exclusive benefits to\\r\\ntheir own citizens. The infractions of these regulations, on one side,\\r\\nthe efforts to prevent and repel them, on the other, would naturally\\r\\nlead to outrages, and these to reprisals and wars.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe opportunities which some States would have of rendering others\\r\\ntributary to them by commercial regulations would be impatiently\\r\\nsubmitted to by the tributary States. The relative situation of New\\r\\nYork, Connecticut, and New Jersey would afford an example of this\\r\\nkind. New York, from the necessities of revenue, must lay duties on\\r\\nher importations. A great part of these duties must be paid by the\\r\\ninhabitants of the two other States in the capacity of consumers of what\\r\\nwe import. New York would neither be willing nor able to forego this\\r\\nadvantage. Her citizens would not consent that a duty paid by them\\r\\nshould be remitted in favor of the citizens of her neighbors; nor would\\r\\nit be practicable, if there were not this impediment in the way, to\\r\\ndistinguish the customers in our own markets. Would Connecticut and New\\r\\nJersey long submit to be taxed by New York for her exclusive benefit?\\r\\nShould we be long permitted to remain in the quiet and undisturbed\\r\\nenjoyment of a metropolis, from the possession of which we derived\\r\\nan advantage so odious to our neighbors, and, in their opinion, so\\r\\noppressive? Should we be able to preserve it against the incumbent\\r\\nweight of Connecticut on the one side, and the co-operating pressure of\\r\\nNew Jersey on the other? These are questions that temerity alone will\\r\\nanswer in the affirmative.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe public debt of the Union would be a further cause of collision\\r\\nbetween the separate States or confederacies. The apportionment, in the\\r\\nfirst instance, and the progressive extinguishment afterward, would be\\r\\nalike productive of ill-humor and animosity. How would it be possible\\r\\nto agree upon a rule of apportionment satisfactory to all? There is\\r\\nscarcely any that can be proposed which is entirely free from real\\r\\nobjections. These, as usual, would be exaggerated by the adverse\\r\\ninterest of the parties. There are even dissimilar views among the\\r\\nStates as to the general principle of discharging the public debt. Some\\r\\nof them, either less impressed with the importance of national credit,\\r\\nor because their citizens have little, if any, immediate interest in the\\r\\nquestion, feel an indifference, if not a repugnance, to the payment of\\r\\nthe domestic debt at any rate. These would be inclined to magnify the\\r\\ndifficulties of a distribution. Others of them, a numerous body of whose\\r\\ncitizens are creditors to the public beyond proportion of the State\\r\\nin the total amount of the national debt, would be strenuous for some\\r\\nequitable and effective provision. The procrastinations of the former\\r\\nwould excite the resentments of the latter. The settlement of a rule\\r\\nwould, in the meantime, be postponed by real differences of opinion and\\r\\naffected delays. The citizens of the States interested would clamour;\\r\\nforeign powers would urge for the satisfaction of their just demands,\\r\\nand the peace of the States would be hazarded to the double contingency\\r\\nof external invasion and internal contention.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuppose the difficulties of agreeing upon a rule surmounted, and the\\r\\napportionment made. Still there is great room to suppose that the rule\\r\\nagreed upon would, upon experiment, be found to bear harder upon\\r\\nsome States than upon others. Those which were sufferers by it would\\r\\nnaturally seek for a mitigation of the burden. The others would as\\r\\nnaturally be disinclined to a revision, which was likely to end in an\\r\\nincrease of their own incumbrances. Their refusal would be too plausible\\r\\na pretext to the complaining States to withhold their contributions, not\\r\\nto be embraced with avidity; and the non-compliance of these States\\r\\nwith their engagements would be a ground of bitter discussion and\\r\\naltercation. If even the rule adopted should in practice justify the\\r\\nequality of its principle, still delinquencies in payments on the part\\r\\nof some of the States would result from a diversity of other causes--the\\r\\nreal deficiency of resources; the mismanagement of their finances;\\r\\naccidental disorders in the management of the government; and, in\\r\\naddition to the rest, the reluctance with which men commonly part with\\r\\nmoney for purposes that have outlived the exigencies which produced\\r\\nthem, and interfere with the supply of immediate wants. Delinquencies,\\r\\nfrom whatever causes, would be productive of complaints, recriminations,\\r\\nand quarrels. There is, perhaps, nothing more likely to disturb the\\r\\ntranquillity of nations than their being bound to mutual contributions\\r\\nfor any common object that does not yield an equal and coincident\\r\\nbenefit. For it is an observation, as true as it is trite, that there is\\r\\nnothing men differ so readily about as the payment of money.\\r\\n\\r\\nLaws in violation of private contracts, as they amount to aggressions\\r\\non the rights of those States whose citizens are injured by them, may\\r\\nbe considered as another probable source of hostility. We are not\\r\\nauthorized to expect that a more liberal or more equitable spirit would\\r\\npreside over the legislations of the individual States hereafter, if\\r\\nunrestrained by any additional checks, than we have heretofore seen in\\r\\ntoo many instances disgracing their several codes. We have observed the\\r\\ndisposition to retaliation excited in Connecticut in consequence of\\r\\nthe enormities perpetrated by the Legislature of Rhode Island; and we\\r\\nreasonably infer that, in similar cases, under other circumstances, a\\r\\nwar, not of PARCHMENT, but of the sword, would chastise such atrocious\\r\\nbreaches of moral obligation and social justice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe probability of incompatible alliances between the different States\\r\\nor confederacies and different foreign nations, and the effects of this\\r\\nsituation upon the peace of the whole, have been sufficiently unfolded\\r\\nin some preceding papers. From the view they have exhibited of this part\\r\\nof the subject, this conclusion is to be drawn, that America, if\\r\\nnot connected at all, or only by the feeble tie of a simple league,\\r\\noffensive and defensive, would, by the operation of such jarring\\r\\nalliances, be gradually entangled in all the pernicious labyrinths of\\r\\nEuropean politics and wars; and by the destructive contentions of the\\r\\nparts into which she was divided, would be likely to become a prey to\\r\\nthe artifices and machinations of powers equally the enemies of them\\r\\nall.

Tuesday, November 20, 1787.\\r\\n\\r\\nHAMILTON\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\r\\n\\r\\nASSUMING it therefore as an established truth that the several States,\\r\\nin case of disunion, or such combinations of them as might happen to be\\r\\nformed out of the wreck of the general Confederacy, would be subject to\\r\\nthose vicissitudes of peace and war, of friendship and enmity, with\\r\\neach other, which have fallen to the lot of all neighboring nations not\\r\\nunited under one government, let us enter into a concise detail of some\\r\\nof the consequences that would attend such a situation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWar between the States, in the first period of their separate existence,\\r\\nwould be accompanied with much greater distresses than it commonly is\\r\\nin those countries where regular military establishments have long\\r\\nobtained. The disciplined armies always kept on foot on the continent\\r\\nof Europe, though they bear a malignant aspect to liberty and economy,\\r\\nhave, notwithstanding, been productive of the signal advantage of\\r\\nrendering sudden conquests impracticable, and of preventing that\\r\\nrapid desolation which used to mark the progress of war prior to their\\r\\nintroduction. The art of fortification has contributed to the same ends.\\r\\nThe nations of Europe are encircled with chains of fortified places,\\r\\nwhich mutually obstruct invasion. Campaigns are wasted in reducing two\\r\\nor three frontier garrisons, to gain admittance into an enemy's country.\\r\\nSimilar impediments occur at every step, to exhaust the strength and\\r\\ndelay the progress of an invader. Formerly, an invading army would\\r\\npenetrate into the heart of a neighboring country almost as soon as\\r\\nintelligence of its approach could be received; but now a comparatively\\r\\nsmall force of disciplined troops, acting on the defensive, with the aid\\r\\nof posts, is able to impede, and finally to frustrate, the enterprises\\r\\nof one much more considerable. The history of war, in that quarter\\r\\nof the globe, is no longer a history of nations subdued and empires\\r\\noverturned, but of towns taken and retaken; of battles that decide\\r\\nnothing; of retreats more beneficial than victories; of much effort and\\r\\nlittle acquisition.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this country the scene would be altogether reversed. The jealousy\\r\\nof military establishments would postpone them as long as possible.\\r\\nThe want of fortifications, leaving the frontiers of one state open\\r\\nto another, would facilitate inroads. The populous States would, with\\r\\nlittle difficulty, overrun their less populous neighbors. Conquests\\r\\nwould be as easy to be made as difficult to be retained. War, therefore,\\r\\nwould be desultory and predatory. PLUNDER and devastation ever march in\\r\\nthe train of irregulars. The calamities of individuals would make the\\r\\nprincipal figure in the events which would characterize our military\\r\\nexploits.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis picture is not too highly wrought; though, I confess, it would not\\r\\nlong remain a just one. Safety from external danger is the most powerful\\r\\ndirector of national conduct. Even the ardent love of liberty will,\\r\\nafter a time, give way to its dictates. The violent destruction of life\\r\\nand property incident to war, the continual effort and alarm attendant\\r\\non a state of continual danger, will compel nations the most attached to\\r\\nliberty to resort for repose and security to institutions which have a\\r\\ntendency to destroy their civil and political rights. To be more safe,\\r\\nthey at length become willing to run the risk of being less free.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe institutions chiefly alluded to are STANDING ARMIES and the\\r\\ncorrespondent appendages of military establishments. Standing armies,\\r\\nit is said, are not provided against in the new Constitution; and it\\r\\nis therefore inferred that they may exist under it.(1) Their existence,\\r\\nhowever, from the very terms of the proposition, is, at most,\\r\\nproblematical and uncertain. But standing armies, it may be replied,\\r\\nmust inevitably result from a dissolution of the Confederacy. Frequent\\r\\nwar and constant apprehension, which require a state of as constant\\r\\npreparation, will infallibly produce them. The weaker States or\\r\\nconfederacies would first have recourse to them, to put themselves upon\\r\\nan equality with their more potent neighbors. They would endeavor to\\r\\nsupply the inferiority of population and resources by a more regular\\r\\nand effective system of defense, by disciplined troops, and by\\r\\nfortifications. They would, at the same time, be necessitated to\\r\\nstrengthen the executive arm of government, in doing which their\\r\\nconstitutions would acquire a progressive direction toward monarchy. It\\r\\nis of the nature of war to increase the executive at the expense of the\\r\\nlegislative authority.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe expedients which have been mentioned would soon give the States or\\r\\nconfederacies that made use of them a superiority over their neighbors.\\r\\nSmall states, or states of less natural strength, under vigorous\\r\\ngovernments, and with the assistance of disciplined armies, have often\\r\\ntriumphed over large states, or states of greater natural strength,\\r\\nwhich have been destitute of these advantages. Neither the pride nor the\\r\\nsafety of the more important States or confederacies would permit them\\r\\nlong to submit to this mortifying and adventitious superiority. They\\r\\nwould quickly resort to means similar to those by which it had been\\r\\neffected, to reinstate themselves in their lost pre-eminence. Thus, we\\r\\nshould, in a little time, see established in every part of this country\\r\\nthe same engines of despotism which have been the scourge of the Old\\r\\nWorld. This, at least, would be the natural course of things; and our\\r\\nreasonings will be the more likely to be just, in proportion as they are\\r\\naccommodated to this standard.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are not vague inferences drawn from supposed or speculative\\r\\ndefects in a Constitution, the whole power of which is lodged in the\\r\\nhands of a people, or their representatives and delegates, but they\\r\\nare solid conclusions, drawn from the natural and necessary progress of\\r\\nhuman affairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may, perhaps, be asked, by way of objection to this, why did\\r\\nnot standing armies spring up out of the contentions which so often\\r\\ndistracted the ancient republics of Greece? Different answers, equally\\r\\nsatisfactory, may be given to this question. The industrious habits of\\r\\nthe people of the present day, absorbed in the pursuits of gain,\\r\\nand devoted to the improvements of agriculture and commerce, are\\r\\nincompatible with the condition of a nation of soldiers, which was the\\r\\ntrue condition of the people of those republics. The means of revenue,\\r\\nwhich have been so greatly multiplied by the increase of gold and silver\\r\\nand of the arts of industry, and the science of finance, which is the\\r\\noffspring of modern times, concurring with the habits of nations, have\\r\\nproduced an entire revolution in the system of war, and have rendered\\r\\ndisciplined armies, distinct from the body of the citizens, the\\r\\ninseparable companions of frequent hostility.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a wide difference, also, between military establishments in a\\r\\ncountry seldom exposed by its situation to internal invasions, and in\\r\\none which is often subject to them, and always apprehensive of them.\\r\\nThe rulers of the former can have no good pretext, if they are even so\\r\\ninclined, to keep on foot armies so numerous as must of necessity be\\r\\nmaintained in the latter. These armies being, in the first case, rarely,\\r\\nif at all, called into activity for interior defense, the people are in\\r\\nno danger of being broken to military subordination. The laws are not\\r\\naccustomed to relaxations, in favor of military exigencies; the civil\\r\\nstate remains in full vigor, neither corrupted, nor confounded with the\\r\\nprinciples or propensities of the other state. The smallness of the army\\r\\nrenders the natural strength of the community an overmatch for it;\\r\\nand the citizens, not habituated to look up to the military power for\\r\\nprotection, or to submit to its oppressions, neither love nor fear the\\r\\nsoldiery; they view them with a spirit of jealous acquiescence in a\\r\\nnecessary evil, and stand ready to resist a power which they suppose may\\r\\nbe exerted to the prejudice of their rights.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe army under such circumstances may usefully aid the magistrate to\\r\\nsuppress a small faction, or an occasional mob, or insurrection; but it\\r\\nwill be unable to enforce encroachments against the united efforts of\\r\\nthe great body of the people.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a country in the predicament last described, the contrary of all this\\r\\nhappens. The perpetual menacings of danger oblige the government to\\r\\nbe always prepared to repel it; its armies must be numerous enough for\\r\\ninstant defense. The continual necessity for their services enhances the\\r\\nimportance of the soldier, and proportionably degrades the condition of\\r\\nthe citizen. The military state becomes elevated above the civil. The\\r\\ninhabitants of territories, often the theatre of war, are unavoidably\\r\\nsubjected to frequent infringements on their rights, which serve to\\r\\nweaken their sense of those rights; and by degrees the people are\\r\\nbrought to consider the soldiery not only as their protectors, but\\r\\nas their superiors. The transition from this disposition to that of\\r\\nconsidering them masters, is neither remote nor difficult; but it is\\r\\nvery difficult to prevail upon a people under such impressions, to make\\r\\na bold or effectual resistance to usurpations supported by the military\\r\\npower.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe kingdom of Great Britain falls within the first description. An\\r\\ninsular situation, and a powerful marine, guarding it in a great measure\\r\\nagainst the possibility of foreign invasion, supersede the necessity\\r\\nof a numerous army within the kingdom. A sufficient force to make head\\r\\nagainst a sudden descent, till the militia could have time to rally and\\r\\nembody, is all that has been deemed requisite. No motive of national\\r\\npolicy has demanded, nor would public opinion have tolerated, a larger\\r\\nnumber of troops upon its domestic establishment. There has been, for a\\r\\nlong time past, little room for the operation of the other causes, which\\r\\nhave been enumerated as the consequences of internal war. This peculiar\\r\\nfelicity of situation has, in a great degree, contributed to preserve\\r\\nthe liberty which that country to this day enjoys, in spite of the\\r\\nprevalent venality and corruption. If, on the contrary, Britain had been\\r\\nsituated on the continent, and had been compelled, as she would have\\r\\nbeen, by that situation, to make her military establishments at home\\r\\ncoextensive with those of the other great powers of Europe, she, like\\r\\nthem, would in all probability be, at this day, a victim to the absolute\\r\\npower of a single man. It is possible, though not easy, that the people\\r\\nof that island may be enslaved from other causes; but it cannot be by\\r\\nthe prowess of an army so inconsiderable as that which has been usually\\r\\nkept up within the kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we are wise enough to preserve the Union we may for ages enjoy an\\r\\nadvantage similar to that of an insulated situation. Europe is at a\\r\\ngreat distance from us. Her colonies in our vicinity will be likely to\\r\\ncontinue too much disproportioned in strength to be able to give us any\\r\\ndangerous annoyance. Extensive military establishments cannot, in this\\r\\nposition, be necessary to our security. But if we should be disunited,\\r\\nand the integral parts should either remain separated, or, which is most\\r\\nprobable, should be thrown together into two or three confederacies,\\r\\nwe should be, in a short course of time, in the predicament of the\\r\\ncontinental powers of Europe--our liberties would be a prey to the means\\r\\nof defending ourselves against the ambition and jealousy of each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is an idea not superficial or futile, but solid and weighty. It\\r\\ndeserves the most serious and mature consideration of every prudent and\\r\\nhonest man of whatever party. If such men will make a firm and\\r\\nsolemn pause, and meditate dispassionately on the importance of this\\r\\ninteresting idea; if they will contemplate it in all its attitudes, and\\r\\ntrace it to all its consequences, they will not hesitate to part with\\r\\ntrivial objections to a Constitution, the rejection of which would in\\r\\nall probability put a final period to the Union. The airy phantoms that\\r\\nflit before the distempered imaginations of some of its adversaries\\r\\nwould quickly give place to the more substantial forms of dangers, real,\\r\\ncertain, and formidable.\\r\\n\\r\\nPUBLIUS\\r\\n\\r\\n1. This objection will be fully examined in its proper place, and it\\r\\nwill be shown that the only natural precaution which could have been\\r\\ntaken on this subject has been taken; and a much better one than is to\\r\\nbe found in any constitution that has been heretofore framed in America,\\r\\nmost of which contain no guard at all on this subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\", \"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the Independent Journal. Wednesday, November 21, 1787\\r\\n\\r\\nHAMILTON\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\r\\n\\r\\nA FIRM Union will be of the utmost moment to the peace and liberty of\\r\\nthe States, as a barrier against domestic faction and insurrection. It\\r\\nis impossible to read the history of the petty republics of Greece\\r\\nand Italy without feeling sensations of horror and disgust at the\\r\\ndistractions with which they were continually agitated, and at the\\r\\nrapid succession of revolutions by which they were kept in a state of\\r\\nperpetual vibration between the extremes of tyranny and anarchy. If they\\r\\nexhibit occasional calms, these only serve as short-lived contrast to\\r\\nthe furious storms that are to succeed. If now and then intervals of\\r\\nfelicity open to view, we behold them with a mixture of regret, arising\\r\\nfrom the reflection that the pleasing scenes before us are soon to be\\r\\noverwhelmed by the tempestuous waves of sedition and party rage. If\\r\\nmomentary rays of glory break forth from the gloom, while they dazzle us\\r\\nwith a transient and fleeting brilliancy, they at the same time admonish\\r\\nus to lament that the vices of government should pervert the direction\\r\\nand tarnish the lustre of those bright talents and exalted endowments\\r\\nfor which the favored soils that produced them have been so justly\\r\\ncelebrated.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the disorders that disfigure the annals of those republics the\\r\\nadvocates of despotism have drawn arguments, not only against the forms\\r\\nof republican government, but against the very principles of civil\\r\\nliberty. They have decried all free government as inconsistent with the\\r\\norder of society, and have indulged themselves in malicious exultation\\r\\nover its friends and partisans. Happily for mankind, stupendous fabrics\\r\\nreared on the basis of liberty, which have flourished for ages, have, in\\r\\na few glorious instances, refuted their gloomy sophisms. And, I trust,\\r\\nAmerica will be the broad and solid foundation of other edifices, not\\r\\nless magnificent, which will be equally permanent monuments of their\\r\\nerrors.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it is not to be denied that the portraits they have sketched of\\r\\nrepublican government were too just copies of the originals from which\\r\\nthey were taken. If it had been found impracticable to have devised\\r\\nmodels of a more perfect structure, the enlightened friends to liberty\\r\\nwould have been obliged to abandon the cause of that species of\\r\\ngovernment as indefensible. The science of politics, however, like most\\r\\nother sciences, has received great improvement. The efficacy of various\\r\\nprinciples is now well understood, which were either not known at all,\\r\\nor imperfectly known to the ancients. The regular distribution of power\\r\\ninto distinct departments; the introduction of legislative balances\\r\\nand checks; the institution of courts composed of judges holding their\\r\\noffices during good behavior; the representation of the people in the\\r\\nlegislature by deputies of their own election: these are wholly new\\r\\ndiscoveries, or have made their principal progress towards perfection\\r\\nin modern times. They are means, and powerful means, by which\\r\\nthe excellences of republican government may be retained and its\\r\\nimperfections lessened or avoided. To this catalogue of circumstances\\r\\nthat tend to the amelioration of popular systems of civil government, I\\r\\nshall venture, however novel it may appear to some, to add one more, on\\r\\na principle which has been made the foundation of an objection to the\\r\\nnew Constitution; I mean the ENLARGEMENT of the ORBIT within which such\\r\\nsystems are to revolve, either in respect to the dimensions of a single\\r\\nState or to the consolidation of several smaller States into one great\\r\\nConfederacy. The latter is that which immediately concerns the object\\r\\nunder consideration. It will, however, be of use to examine the\\r\\nprinciple in its application to a single State, which shall be attended\\r\\nto in another place.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe utility of a Confederacy, as well to suppress faction and to guard\\r\\nthe internal tranquillity of States, as to increase their external force\\r\\nand security, is in reality not a new idea. It has been practiced upon\\r\\nin different countries and ages, and has received the sanction of the\\r\\nmost approved writers on the subject of politics. The opponents of\\r\\nthe plan proposed have, with great assiduity, cited and circulated the\\r\\nobservations of Montesquieu on the necessity of a contracted territory\\r\\nfor a republican government. But they seem not to have been apprised of\\r\\nthe sentiments of that great man expressed in another part of his work,\\r\\nnor to have adverted to the consequences of the principle to which they\\r\\nsubscribe with such ready acquiescence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Montesquieu recommends a small extent for republics, the standards\\r\\nhe had in view were of dimensions far short of the limits of\\r\\nalmost every one of these States. Neither Virginia, Massachusetts,\\r\\nPennsylvania, New York, North Carolina, nor Georgia can by any means be\\r\\ncompared with the models from which he reasoned and to which the terms\\r\\nof his description apply. If we therefore take his ideas on this point\\r\\nas the criterion of truth, we shall be driven to the alternative either\\r\\nof taking refuge at once in the arms of monarchy, or of splitting\\r\\nourselves into an infinity of little, jealous, clashing, tumultuous\\r\\ncommonwealths, the wretched nurseries of unceasing discord, and the\\r\\nmiserable objects of universal pity or contempt. Some of the writers who\\r\\nhave come forward on the other side of the question seem to have been\\r\\naware of the dilemma; and have even been bold enough to hint at the\\r\\ndivision of the larger States as a desirable thing. Such an infatuated\\r\\npolicy, such a desperate expedient, might, by the multiplication of\\r\\npetty offices, answer the views of men who possess not qualifications to\\r\\nextend their influence beyond the narrow circles of personal intrigue,\\r\\nbut it could never promote the greatness or happiness of the people of\\r\\nAmerica.\\r\\n\\r\\nReferring the examination of the principle itself to another place, as\\r\\nhas been already mentioned, it will be sufficient to remark here that,\\r\\nin the sense of the author who has been most emphatically quoted upon\\r\\nthe occasion, it would only dictate a reduction of the SIZE of the more\\r\\nconsiderable MEMBERS of the Union, but would not militate against their\\r\\nbeing all comprehended in one confederate government. And this is the\\r\\ntrue question, in the discussion of which we are at present interested.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far are the suggestions of Montesquieu from standing in opposition\\r\\nto a general Union of the States, that he explicitly treats of a\\r\\nconfederate republic as the expedient for extending the sphere of\\r\\npopular government, and reconciling the advantages of monarchy with\\r\\nthose of republicanism.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"It is very probable,\\\" (says he(1)) \\\"that mankind would have been\\r\\nobliged at length to live constantly under the government of a single\\r\\nperson, had they not contrived a kind of constitution that has all the\\r\\ninternal advantages of a republican, together with the external force of\\r\\na monarchical government. I mean a CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"This form of government is a convention by which several smaller STATES\\r\\nagree to become members of a larger ONE, which they intend to form. It\\r\\nis a kind of assemblage of societies that constitute a new one, capable\\r\\nof increasing, by means of new associations, till they arrive to such a\\r\\ndegree of power as to be able to provide for the security of the united\\r\\nbody.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"A republic of this kind, able to withstand an external force, may\\r\\nsupport itself without any internal corruptions. The form of this\\r\\nsociety prevents all manner of inconveniences.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"If a single member should attempt to usurp the supreme authority, he\\r\\ncould not be supposed to have an equal authority and credit in all the\\r\\nconfederate states. Were he to have too great influence over one, this\\r\\nwould alarm the rest. Were he to subdue a part, that which would still\\r\\nremain free might oppose him with forces independent of those which\\r\\nhe had usurped and overpower him before he could be settled in his\\r\\nusurpation.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Should a popular insurrection happen in one of the confederate states\\r\\nthe others are able to quell it. Should abuses creep into one part, they\\r\\nare reformed by those that remain sound. The state may be destroyed on\\r\\none side, and not on the other; the confederacy may be dissolved, and\\r\\nthe confederates preserve their sovereignty.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"As this government is composed of small republics, it enjoys the\\r\\ninternal happiness of each; and with respect to its external situation,\\r\\nit is possessed, by means of the association, of all the advantages of\\r\\nlarge monarchies.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI have thought it proper to quote at length these interesting passages,\\r\\nbecause they contain a luminous abridgment of the principal arguments\\r\\nin favor of the Union, and must effectually remove the false impressions\\r\\nwhich a misapplication of other parts of the work was calculated to\\r\\nmake. They have, at the same time, an intimate connection with the more\\r\\nimmediate design of this paper; which is, to illustrate the tendency of\\r\\nthe Union to repress domestic faction and insurrection.\\r\\n\\r\\nA distinction, more subtle than accurate, has been raised between\\r\\na CONFEDERACY and a CONSOLIDATION of the States. The essential\\r\\ncharacteristic of the first is said to be, the restriction of its\\r\\nauthority to the members in their collective capacities, without\\r\\nreaching to the individuals of whom they are composed. It is contended\\r\\nthat the national council ought to have no concern with any object\\r\\nof internal administration. An exact equality of suffrage between\\r\\nthe members has also been insisted upon as a leading feature of a\\r\\nconfederate government. These positions are, in the main, arbitrary;\\r\\nthey are supported neither by principle nor precedent. It has indeed\\r\\nhappened, that governments of this kind have generally operated in the\\r\\nmanner which the distinction taken notice of, supposes to be inherent in\\r\\ntheir nature; but there have been in most of them extensive exceptions\\r\\nto the practice, which serve to prove, as far as example will go, that\\r\\nthere is no absolute rule on the subject. And it will be clearly\\r\\nshown in the course of this investigation that as far as the principle\\r\\ncontended for has prevailed, it has been the cause of incurable disorder\\r\\nand imbecility in the government.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe definition of a CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC seems simply to be \\\"an\\r\\nassemblage of societies,\\\" or an association of two or more states\\r\\ninto one state. The extent, modifications, and objects of the federal\\r\\nauthority are mere matters of discretion. So long as the separate\\r\\norganization of the members be not abolished; so long as it exists, by\\r\\na constitutional necessity, for local purposes; though it should be in\\r\\nperfect subordination to the general authority of the union, it\\r\\nwould still be, in fact and in theory, an association of states, or\\r\\na confederacy. The proposed Constitution, so far from implying an\\r\\nabolition of the State governments, makes them constituent parts of the\\r\\nnational sovereignty, by allowing them a direct representation in\\r\\nthe Senate, and leaves in their possession certain exclusive and very\\r\\nimportant portions of sovereign power. This fully corresponds, in every\\r\\nrational import of the terms, with the idea of a federal government.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Lycian confederacy, which consisted of twenty-three CITIES\\r\\nor republics, the largest were entitled to THREE votes in the COMMON\\r\\nCOUNCIL, those of the middle class to TWO, and the smallest to ONE. The\\r\\nCOMMON COUNCIL had the appointment of all the judges and magistrates of\\r\\nthe respective CITIES. This was certainly the most, delicate species of\\r\\ninterference in their internal administration; for if there be any thing\\r\\nthat seems exclusively appropriated to the local jurisdictions, it is\\r\\nthe appointment of their own officers. Yet Montesquieu, speaking of this\\r\\nassociation, says: \\\"Were I to give a model of an excellent Confederate\\r\\nRepublic, it would be that of Lycia.\\\" Thus we perceive that the\\r\\ndistinctions insisted upon were not within the contemplation of this\\r\\nenlightened civilian; and we shall be led to conclude, that they are the\\r\\nnovel refinements of an erroneous theory.\\r\\n\\r\\nPUBLIUS\\r\\n\\r\\n1. \\\"Spirit of Laws,\\\" vol. i., book ix., chap. i.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\", \"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Same Subject Continued (The Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic\\r\\nFaction and Insurrection)\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the Daily Advertiser. Thursday, November 22, 1787.\\r\\n\\r\\nMADISON\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\r\\n\\r\\nAMONG the numerous advantages promised by a well constructed Union, none\\r\\ndeserves to be more accurately developed than its tendency to break and\\r\\ncontrol the violence of faction. The friend of popular governments never\\r\\nfinds himself so much alarmed for their character and fate, as when he\\r\\ncontemplates their propensity to this dangerous vice. He will not fail,\\r\\ntherefore, to set a due value on any plan which, without violating the\\r\\nprinciples to which he is attached, provides a proper cure for it.\\r\\nThe instability, injustice, and confusion introduced into the public\\r\\ncouncils, have, in truth, been the mortal diseases under which popular\\r\\ngovernments have everywhere perished; as they continue to be the\\r\\nfavorite and fruitful topics from which the adversaries to liberty\\r\\nderive their most specious declamations. The valuable improvements made\\r\\nby the American constitutions on the popular models, both ancient\\r\\nand modern, cannot certainly be too much admired; but it would be an\\r\\nunwarrantable partiality, to contend that they have as effectually\\r\\nobviated the danger on this side, as was wished and expected. Complaints\\r\\nare everywhere heard from our most considerate and virtuous citizens,\\r\\nequally the friends of public and private faith, and of public and\\r\\npersonal liberty, that our governments are too unstable, that the public\\r\\ngood is disregarded in the conflicts of rival parties, and that measures\\r\\nare too often decided, not according to the rules of justice and the\\r\\nrights of the minor party, but by the superior force of an interested\\r\\nand overbearing majority. However anxiously we may wish that these\\r\\ncomplaints had no foundation, the evidence, of known facts will not\\r\\npermit us to deny that they are in some degree true. It will be found,\\r\\nindeed, on a candid review of our situation, that some of the distresses\\r\\nunder which we labor have been erroneously charged on the operation\\r\\nof our governments; but it will be found, at the same time, that other\\r\\ncauses will not alone account for many of our heaviest misfortunes;\\r\\nand, particularly, for that prevailing and increasing distrust of public\\r\\nengagements, and alarm for private rights, which are echoed from one\\r\\nend of the continent to the other. These must be chiefly, if not wholly,\\r\\neffects of the unsteadiness and injustice with which a factious spirit\\r\\nhas tainted our public administrations.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a\\r\\nmajority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some\\r\\ncommon impulse of passion, or of interest, adversed to the rights of\\r\\nother citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the\\r\\ncommunity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two methods of curing the mischiefs of faction: the one, by\\r\\nremoving its causes; the other, by controlling its effects.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are again two methods of removing the causes of faction: the\\r\\none, by destroying the liberty which is essential to its existence; the\\r\\nother, by giving to every citizen the same opinions, the same passions,\\r\\nand the same interests.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt could never be more truly said than of the first remedy, that it was\\r\\nworse than the disease. Liberty is to faction what air is to fire, an\\r\\naliment without which it instantly expires. But it could not be less\\r\\nfolly to abolish liberty, which is essential to political life, because\\r\\nit nourishes faction, than it would be to wish the annihilation of\\r\\nair, which is essential to animal life, because it imparts to fire its\\r\\ndestructive agency.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second expedient is as impracticable as the first would be unwise.\\r\\nAs long as the reason of man continues fallible, and he is at liberty\\r\\nto exercise it, different opinions will be formed. As long as the\\r\\nconnection subsists between his reason and his self-love, his opinions\\r\\nand his passions will have a reciprocal influence on each other; and the\\r\\nformer will be objects to which the latter will attach themselves. The\\r\\ndiversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of property\\r\\noriginate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to a uniformity of\\r\\ninterests. The protection of these faculties is the first object of\\r\\ngovernment. From the protection of different and unequal faculties of\\r\\nacquiring property, the possession of different degrees and kinds of\\r\\nproperty immediately results; and from the influence of these on the\\r\\nsentiments and views of the respective proprietors, ensues a division of\\r\\nthe society into different interests and parties.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latent causes of faction are thus sown in the nature of man; and\\r\\nwe see them everywhere brought into different degrees of activity,\\r\\naccording to the different circumstances of civil society. A zeal for\\r\\ndifferent opinions concerning religion, concerning government, and many\\r\\nother points, as well of speculation as of practice; an attachment to\\r\\ndifferent leaders ambitiously contending for pre-eminence and power; or\\r\\nto persons of other descriptions whose fortunes have been interesting\\r\\nto the human passions, have, in turn, divided mankind into parties,\\r\\ninflamed them with mutual animosity, and rendered them much more\\r\\ndisposed to vex and oppress each other than to co-operate for their\\r\\ncommon good. So strong is this propensity of mankind to fall into mutual\\r\\nanimosities, that where no substantial occasion presents itself, the\\r\\nmost frivolous and fanciful distinctions have been sufficient to kindle\\r\\ntheir unfriendly passions and excite their most violent conflicts. But\\r\\nthe most common and durable source of factions has been the various\\r\\nand unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those who are\\r\\nwithout property have ever formed distinct interests in society.\\r\\nThose who are creditors, and those who are debtors, fall under a\\r\\nlike discrimination. A landed interest, a manufacturing interest, a\\r\\nmercantile interest, a moneyed interest, with many lesser interests,\\r\\ngrow up of necessity in civilized nations, and divide them into\\r\\ndifferent classes, actuated by different sentiments and views. The\\r\\nregulation of these various and interfering interests forms the\\r\\nprincipal task of modern legislation, and involves the spirit of party\\r\\nand faction in the necessary and ordinary operations of the government.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause, because his interest\\r\\nwould certainly bias his judgment, and, not improbably, corrupt his\\r\\nintegrity. With equal, nay with greater reason, a body of men are unfit\\r\\nto be both judges and parties at the same time; yet what are many of the\\r\\nmost important acts of legislation, but so many judicial determinations,\\r\\nnot indeed concerning the rights of single persons, but concerning the\\r\\nrights of large bodies of citizens? And what are the different classes\\r\\nof legislators but advocates and parties to the causes which they\\r\\ndetermine? Is a law proposed concerning private debts? It is a question\\r\\nto which the creditors are parties on one side and the debtors on the\\r\\nother. Justice ought to hold the balance between them. Yet the parties\\r\\nare, and must be, themselves the judges; and the most numerous party,\\r\\nor, in other words, the most powerful faction must be expected to\\r\\nprevail. Shall domestic manufactures be encouraged, and in what degree,\\r\\nby restrictions on foreign manufactures? are questions which would be\\r\\ndifferently decided by the landed and the manufacturing classes, and\\r\\nprobably by neither with a sole regard to justice and the public good.\\r\\nThe apportionment of taxes on the various descriptions of property is\\r\\nan act which seems to require the most exact impartiality; yet there is,\\r\\nperhaps, no legislative act in which greater opportunity and temptation\\r\\nare given to a predominant party to trample on the rules of justice.\\r\\nEvery shilling with which they overburden the inferior number, is a\\r\\nshilling saved to their own pockets.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is in vain to say that enlightened statesmen will be able to adjust\\r\\nthese clashing interests, and render them all subservient to the public\\r\\ngood. Enlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm. Nor, in many\\r\\ncases, can such an adjustment be made at all without taking into view\\r\\nindirect and remote considerations, which will rarely prevail over the\\r\\nimmediate interest which one party may find in disregarding the rights\\r\\nof another or the good of the whole.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inference to which we are brought is, that the CAUSES of faction\\r\\ncannot be removed, and that relief is only to be sought in the means of\\r\\ncontrolling its EFFECTS.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a faction consists of less than a majority, relief is supplied by the\\r\\nrepublican principle, which enables the majority to defeat its sinister\\r\\nviews by regular vote. It may clog the administration, it may convulse\\r\\nthe society; but it will be unable to execute and mask its violence\\r\\nunder the forms of the Constitution. When a majority is included in a\\r\\nfaction, the form of popular government, on the other hand, enables it\\r\\nto sacrifice to its ruling passion or interest both the public good\\r\\nand the rights of other citizens. To secure the public good and private\\r\\nrights against the danger of such a faction, and at the same time to\\r\\npreserve the spirit and the form of popular government, is then the\\r\\ngreat object to which our inquiries are directed. Let me add that it is\\r\\nthe great desideratum by which this form of government can be rescued\\r\\nfrom the opprobrium under which it has so long labored, and be\\r\\nrecommended to the esteem and adoption of mankind.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy what means is this object attainable? Evidently by one of two only.\\r\\nEither the existence of the same passion or interest in a majority at\\r\\nthe same time must be prevented, or the majority, having such coexistent\\r\\npassion or interest, must be rendered, by their number and local\\r\\nsituation, unable to concert and carry into effect schemes of\\r\\noppression. If the impulse and the opportunity be suffered to coincide,\\r\\nwe well know that neither moral nor religious motives can be relied on\\r\\nas an adequate control. They are not found to be such on the injustice\\r\\nand violence of individuals, and lose their efficacy in proportion to\\r\\nthe number combined together, that is, in proportion as their efficacy\\r\\nbecomes needful.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom this view of the subject it may be concluded that a pure democracy,\\r\\nby which I mean a society consisting of a small number of citizens, who\\r\\nassemble and administer the government in person, can admit of no cure\\r\\nfor the mischiefs of faction. A common passion or interest will, in\\r\\nalmost every case, be felt by a majority of the whole; a communication\\r\\nand concert result from the form of government itself; and there is\\r\\nnothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party or an\\r\\nobnoxious individual. Hence it is that such democracies have ever\\r\\nbeen spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found\\r\\nincompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have\\r\\nin general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in\\r\\ntheir deaths. Theoretic politicians, who have patronized this species\\r\\nof government, have erroneously supposed that by reducing mankind to\\r\\na perfect equality in their political rights, they would, at the same\\r\\ntime, be perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions, their\\r\\nopinions, and their passions.\\r\\n\\r\\nA republic, by which I mean a government in which the scheme of\\r\\nrepresentation takes place, opens a different prospect, and promises\\r\\nthe cure for which we are seeking. Let us examine the points in which it\\r\\nvaries from pure democracy, and we shall comprehend both the nature of\\r\\nthe cure and the efficacy which it must derive from the Union.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two great points of difference between a democracy and a republic\\r\\nare: first, the delegation of the government, in the latter, to a small\\r\\nnumber of citizens elected by the rest; secondly, the greater number of\\r\\ncitizens, and greater sphere of country, over which the latter may be\\r\\nextended.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe effect of the first difference is, on the one hand, to refine and\\r\\nenlarge the public views, by passing them through the medium of a chosen\\r\\nbody of citizens, whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of\\r\\ntheir country, and whose patriotism and love of justice will be least\\r\\nlikely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial considerations. Under\\r\\nsuch a regulation, it may well happen that the public voice, pronounced\\r\\nby the representatives of the people, will be more consonant to the\\r\\npublic good than if pronounced by the people themselves, convened for\\r\\nthe purpose. On the other hand, the effect may be inverted. Men of\\r\\nfactious tempers, of local prejudices, or of sinister designs, may, by\\r\\nintrigue, by corruption, or by other means, first obtain the suffrages,\\r\\nand then betray the interests, of the people. The question resulting is,\\r\\nwhether small or extensive republics are more favorable to the election\\r\\nof proper guardians of the public weal; and it is clearly decided in\\r\\nfavor of the latter by two obvious considerations:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first place, it is to be remarked that, however small the\\r\\nrepublic may be, the representatives must be raised to a certain number,\\r\\nin order to guard against the cabals of a few; and that, however large\\r\\nit may be, they must be limited to a certain number, in order to\\r\\nguard against the confusion of a multitude. Hence, the number of\\r\\nrepresentatives in the two cases not being in proportion to that of\\r\\nthe two constituents, and being proportionally greater in the small\\r\\nrepublic, it follows that, if the proportion of fit characters be not\\r\\nless in the large than in the small republic, the former will present a\\r\\ngreater option, and consequently a greater probability of a fit choice.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the next place, as each representative will be chosen by a greater\\r\\nnumber of citizens in the large than in the small republic, it will\\r\\nbe more difficult for unworthy candidates to practice with success the\\r\\nvicious arts by which elections are too often carried; and the suffrages\\r\\nof the people being more free, will be more likely to centre in men who\\r\\npossess the most attractive merit and the most diffusive and established\\r\\ncharacters.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt must be confessed that in this, as in most other cases, there is a\\r\\nmean, on both sides of which inconveniences will be found to lie.\\r\\nBy enlarging too much the number of electors, you render the\\r\\nrepresentatives too little acquainted with all their local circumstances\\r\\nand lesser interests; as by reducing it too much, you render him unduly\\r\\nattached to these, and too little fit to comprehend and pursue great and\\r\\nnational objects. The federal Constitution forms a happy combination in\\r\\nthis respect; the great and aggregate interests being referred to the\\r\\nnational, the local and particular to the State legislatures.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other point of difference is, the greater number of citizens\\r\\nand extent of territory which may be brought within the compass of\\r\\nrepublican than of democratic government; and it is this circumstance\\r\\nprincipally which renders factious combinations less to be dreaded\\r\\nin the former than in the latter. The smaller the society, the fewer\\r\\nprobably will be the distinct parties and interests composing it; the\\r\\nfewer the distinct parties and interests, the more frequently will\\r\\na majority be found of the same party; and the smaller the number of\\r\\nindividuals composing a majority, and the smaller the compass within\\r\\nwhich they are placed, the more easily will they concert and execute\\r\\ntheir plans of oppression. Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater\\r\\nvariety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a\\r\\nmajority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights\\r\\nof other citizens; or if such a common motive exists, it will be more\\r\\ndifficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength, and to act\\r\\nin unison with each other. Besides other impediments, it may be remarked\\r\\nthat, where there is a consciousness of unjust or dishonorable purposes,\\r\\ncommunication is always checked by distrust in proportion to the number\\r\\nwhose concurrence is necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nHence, it clearly appears, that the same advantage which a republic has\\r\\nover a democracy, in controlling the effects of faction, is enjoyed by\\r\\na large over a small republic,--is enjoyed by the Union over the\\r\\nStates composing it. Does the advantage consist in the substitution of\\r\\nrepresentatives whose enlightened views and virtuous sentiments render\\r\\nthem superior to local prejudices and schemes of injustice? It will not\\r\\nbe denied that the representation of the Union will be most likely\\r\\nto possess these requisite endowments. Does it consist in the greater\\r\\nsecurity afforded by a greater variety of parties, against the event of\\r\\nany one party being able to outnumber and oppress the rest? In an equal\\r\\ndegree does the increased variety of parties comprised within the\\r\\nUnion, increase this security. Does it, in fine, consist in the greater\\r\\nobstacles opposed to the concert and accomplishment of the secret wishes\\r\\nof an unjust and interested majority? Here, again, the extent of the\\r\\nUnion gives it the most palpable advantage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within their\\r\\nparticular States, but will be unable to spread a general conflagration\\r\\nthrough the other States. A religious sect may degenerate into a\\r\\npolitical faction in a part of the Confederacy; but the variety of sects\\r\\ndispersed over the entire face of it must secure the national councils\\r\\nagainst any danger from that source. A rage for paper money, for an\\r\\nabolition of debts, for an equal division of property, or for any other\\r\\nimproper or wicked project, will be less apt to pervade the whole body\\r\\nof the Union than a particular member of it; in the same proportion as\\r\\nsuch a malady is more likely to taint a particular county or district,\\r\\nthan an entire State.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the extent and proper structure of the Union, therefore, we behold\\r\\na republican remedy for the diseases most incident to republican\\r\\ngovernment. And according to the degree of pleasure and pride we feel\\r\\nin being republicans, ought to be our zeal in cherishing the spirit and\\r\\nsupporting the character of Federalists.\\r\\n\\r\\nPUBLIUS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\", \"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Utility of the Union in Respect to Commercial Relations and a Navy\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the Independent Journal. Saturday, November 24, 1787\\r\\n\\r\\nHAMILTON\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE importance of the Union, in a commercial light, is one of those\\r\\npoints about which there is least room to entertain a difference of\\r\\nopinion, and which has, in fact, commanded the most general assent of\\r\\nmen who have any acquaintance with the subject. This applies as well to\\r\\nour intercourse with foreign countries as with each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are appearances to authorize a supposition that the adventurous\\r\\nspirit, which distinguishes the commercial character of America, has\\r\\nalready excited uneasy sensations in several of the maritime powers of\\r\\nEurope. They seem to be apprehensive of our too great interference in\\r\\nthat carrying trade, which is the support of their navigation and the\\r\\nfoundation of their naval strength. Those of them which have colonies in\\r\\nAmerica look forward to what this country is capable of becoming, with\\r\\npainful solicitude. They foresee the dangers that may threaten their\\r\\nAmerican dominions from the neighborhood of States, which have all the\\r\\ndispositions, and would possess all the means, requisite to the creation\\r\\nof a powerful marine. Impressions of this kind will naturally indicate\\r\\nthe policy of fostering divisions among us, and of depriving us, as far\\r\\nas possible, of an ACTIVE COMMERCE in our own bottoms. This would\\r\\nanswer the threefold purpose of preventing our interference in their\\r\\nnavigation, of monopolizing the profits of our trade, and of clipping\\r\\nthe wings by which we might soar to a dangerous greatness. Did not\\r\\nprudence forbid the detail, it would not be difficult to trace, by\\r\\nfacts, the workings of this policy to the cabinets of ministers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we continue united, we may counteract a policy so unfriendly to our\\r\\nprosperity in a variety of ways. By prohibitory regulations, extending,\\r\\nat the same time, throughout the States, we may oblige foreign countries\\r\\nto bid against each other, for the privileges of our markets. This\\r\\nassertion will not appear chimerical to those who are able to appreciate\\r\\nthe importance of the markets of three millions of people--increasing\\r\\nin rapid progression, for the most part exclusively addicted to\\r\\nagriculture, and likely from local circumstances to remain so--to any\\r\\nmanufacturing nation; and the immense difference there would be to the\\r\\ntrade and navigation of such a nation, between a direct communication in\\r\\nits own ships, and an indirect conveyance of its products and returns,\\r\\nto and from America, in the ships of another country. Suppose, for\\r\\ninstance, we had a government in America, capable of excluding Great\\r\\nBritain (with whom we have at present no treaty of commerce) from all\\r\\nour ports; what would be the probable operation of this step upon her\\r\\npolitics? Would it not enable us to negotiate, with the fairest prospect\\r\\nof success, for commercial privileges of the most valuable and extensive\\r\\nkind, in the dominions of that kingdom? When these questions have been\\r\\nasked, upon other occasions, they have received a plausible, but not a\\r\\nsolid or satisfactory answer. It has been said that prohibitions on our\\r\\npart would produce no change in the system of Britain, because she could\\r\\nprosecute her trade with us through the medium of the Dutch, who would\\r\\nbe her immediate customers and paymasters for those articles which were\\r\\nwanted for the supply of our markets. But would not her navigation be\\r\\nmaterially injured by the loss of the important advantage of being her\\r\\nown carrier in that trade? Would not the principal part of its profits\\r\\nbe intercepted by the Dutch, as a compensation for their agency and\\r\\nrisk? Would not the mere circumstance of freight occasion a considerable\\r\\ndeduction? Would not so circuitous an intercourse facilitate the\\r\\ncompetitions of other nations, by enhancing the price of British\\r\\ncommodities in our markets, and by transferring to other hands the\\r\\nmanagement of this interesting branch of the British commerce?\\r\\n\\r\\nA mature consideration of the objects suggested by these questions will\\r\\njustify a belief that the real disadvantages to Britain from such a\\r\\nstate of things, conspiring with the pre-possessions of a great part of\\r\\nthe nation in favor of the American trade, and with the importunities\\r\\nof the West India islands, would produce a relaxation in her present\\r\\nsystem, and would let us into the enjoyment of privileges in the markets\\r\\nof those islands elsewhere, from which our trade would derive the most\\r\\nsubstantial benefits. Such a point gained from the British government,\\r\\nand which could not be expected without an equivalent in exemptions\\r\\nand immunities in our markets, would be likely to have a correspondent\\r\\neffect on the conduct of other nations, who would not be inclined to see\\r\\nthemselves altogether supplanted in our trade.\\r\\n\\r\\nA further resource for influencing the conduct of European nations\\r\\ntoward us, in this respect, would arise from the establishment of a\\r\\nfederal navy. There can be no doubt that the continuance of the Union\\r\\nunder an efficient government would put it in our power, at a period not\\r\\nvery distant, to create a navy which, if it could not vie with those of\\r\\nthe great maritime powers, would at least be of respectable weight if\\r\\nthrown into the scale of either of two contending parties. This would be\\r\\nmore peculiarly the case in relation to operations in the West Indies.\\r\\nA few ships of the line, sent opportunely to the reinforcement of either\\r\\nside, would often be sufficient to decide the fate of a campaign, on the\\r\\nevent of which interests of the greatest magnitude were suspended. Our\\r\\nposition is, in this respect, a most commanding one. And if to this\\r\\nconsideration we add that of the usefulness of supplies from this\\r\\ncountry, in the prosecution of military operations in the West Indies,\\r\\nit will readily be perceived that a situation so favorable would enable\\r\\nus to bargain with great advantage for commercial privileges. A price\\r\\nwould be set not only upon our friendship, but upon our neutrality. By\\r\\na steady adherence to the Union we may hope, erelong, to become the\\r\\narbiter of Europe in America, and to be able to incline the balance\\r\\nof European competitions in this part of the world as our interest may\\r\\ndictate.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in the reverse of this eligible situation, we shall discover that\\r\\nthe rivalships of the parts would make them checks upon each other,\\r\\nand would frustrate all the tempting advantages which nature has kindly\\r\\nplaced within our reach. In a state so insignificant our commerce would\\r\\nbe a prey to the wanton intermeddlings of all nations at war with each\\r\\nother; who, having nothing to fear from us, would with little scruple or\\r\\nremorse, supply their wants by depredations on our property as often as\\r\\nit fell in their way. The rights of neutrality will only be respected\\r\\nwhen they are defended by an adequate power. A nation, despicable by its\\r\\nweakness, forfeits even the privilege of being neutral.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder a vigorous national government, the natural strength and resources\\r\\nof the country, directed to a common interest, would baffle all the\\r\\ncombinations of European jealousy to restrain our growth. This situation\\r\\nwould even take away the motive to such combinations, by inducing\\r\\nan impracticability of success. An active commerce, an extensive\\r\\nnavigation, and a flourishing marine would then be the offspring of\\r\\nmoral and physical necessity. We might defy the little arts of the\\r\\nlittle politicians to control or vary the irresistible and unchangeable\\r\\ncourse of nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in a state of disunion, these combinations might exist and might\\r\\noperate with success. It would be in the power of the maritime nations,\\r\\navailing themselves of our universal impotence, to prescribe the\\r\\nconditions of our political existence; and as they have a common\\r\\ninterest in being our carriers, and still more in preventing our\\r\\nbecoming theirs, they would in all probability combine to embarrass our\\r\\nnavigation in such a manner as would in effect destroy it, and confine\\r\\nus to a PASSIVE COMMERCE. We should then be compelled to content\\r\\nourselves with the first price of our commodities, and to see the\\r\\nprofits of our trade snatched from us to enrich our enemies and\\r\\npersecutors. That unequaled spirit of enterprise, which signalizes the\\r\\ngenius of the American merchants and navigators, and which is in itself\\r\\nan inexhaustible mine of national wealth, would be stifled and lost,\\r\\nand poverty and disgrace would overspread a country which, with wisdom,\\r\\nmight make herself the admiration and envy of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are rights of great moment to the trade of America which are\\r\\nrights of the Union--I allude to the fisheries, to the navigation of the\\r\\nWestern lakes, and to that of the Mississippi. The dissolution of the\\r\\nConfederacy would give room for delicate questions concerning the future\\r\\nexistence of these rights; which the interest of more powerful partners\\r\\nwould hardly fail to solve to our disadvantage. The disposition of Spain\\r\\nwith regard to the Mississippi needs no comment. France and Britain\\r\\nare concerned with us in the fisheries, and view them as of the utmost\\r\\nmoment to their navigation. They, of course, would hardly remain long\\r\\nindifferent to that decided mastery, of which experience has shown us\\r\\nto be possessed in this valuable branch of traffic, and by which we are\\r\\nable to undersell those nations in their own markets. What more natural\\r\\nthan that they should be disposed to exclude from the lists such\\r\\ndangerous competitors?\\r\\n\\r\\nThis branch of trade ought not to be considered as a partial benefit.\\r\\nAll the navigating States may, in different degrees, advantageously\\r\\nparticipate in it, and under circumstances of a greater extension of\\r\\nmercantile capital, would not be unlikely to do it. As a nursery of\\r\\nseamen, it now is, or when time shall have more nearly assimilated the\\r\\nprinciples of navigation in the several States, will become, a universal\\r\\nresource. To the establishment of a navy, it must be indispensable.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this great national object, a NAVY, union will contribute in various\\r\\nways. Every institution will grow and flourish in proportion to the\\r\\nquantity and extent of the means concentred towards its formation and\\r\\nsupport. A navy of the United States, as it would embrace the resources\\r\\nof all, is an object far less remote than a navy of any single State or\\r\\npartial confederacy, which would only embrace the resources of a single\\r\\npart. It happens, indeed, that different portions of confederated\\r\\nAmerica possess each some peculiar advantage for this essential\\r\\nestablishment. The more southern States furnish in greater abundance\\r\\ncertain kinds of naval stores--tar, pitch, and turpentine. Their wood\\r\\nfor the construction of ships is also of a more solid and lasting\\r\\ntexture. The difference in the duration of the ships of which the navy\\r\\nmight be composed, if chiefly constructed of Southern wood, would be of\\r\\nsignal importance, either in the view of naval strength or of national\\r\\neconomy. Some of the Southern and of the Middle States yield a greater\\r\\nplenty of iron, and of better quality. Seamen must chiefly be drawn\\r\\nfrom the Northern hive. The necessity of naval protection to external\\r\\nor maritime commerce does not require a particular elucidation, no more\\r\\nthan the conduciveness of that species of commerce to the prosperity of\\r\\na navy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn unrestrained intercourse between the States themselves will advance\\r\\nthe trade of each by an interchange of their respective productions, not\\r\\nonly for the supply of reciprocal wants at home, but for exportation\\r\\nto foreign markets. The veins of commerce in every part will be\\r\\nreplenished, and will acquire additional motion and vigor from a free\\r\\ncirculation of the commodities of every part. Commercial enterprise\\r\\nwill have much greater scope, from the diversity in the productions of\\r\\ndifferent States. When the staple of one fails from a bad harvest or\\r\\nunproductive crop, it can call to its aid the staple of another.\\r\\nThe variety, not less than the value, of products for exportation\\r\\ncontributes to the activity of foreign commerce. It can be conducted\\r\\nupon much better terms with a large number of materials of a given value\\r\\nthan with a small number of materials of the same value; arising\\r\\nfrom the competitions of trade and from the fluctuations of markets.\\r\\nParticular articles may be in great demand at certain periods, and\\r\\nunsalable at others; but if there be a variety of articles, it can\\r\\nscarcely happen that they should all be at one time in the latter\\r\\npredicament, and on this account the operations of the merchant would\\r\\nbe less liable to any considerable obstruction or stagnation.\\r\\nThe speculative trader will at once perceive the force of these\\r\\nobservations, and will acknowledge that the aggregate balance of the\\r\\ncommerce of the United States would bid fair to be much more favorable\\r\\nthan that of the thirteen States without union or with partial unions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may perhaps be replied to this, that whether the States are united\\r\\nor disunited, there would still be an intimate intercourse between them\\r\\nwhich would answer the same ends; this intercourse would be fettered,\\r\\ninterrupted, and narrowed by a multiplicity of causes, which in the\\r\\ncourse of these papers have been amply detailed. A unity of commercial,\\r\\nas well as political, interests, can only result from a unity of\\r\\ngovernment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are other points of view in which this subject might be placed, of\\r\\na striking and animating kind. But they would lead us too far into the\\r\\nregions of futurity, and would involve topics not proper for a newspaper\\r\\ndiscussion. I shall briefly observe, that our situation invites and our\\r\\ninterests prompt us to aim at an ascendant in the system of American\\r\\naffairs. The world may politically, as well as geographically, be\\r\\ndivided into four parts, each having a distinct set of interests.\\r\\nUnhappily for the other three, Europe, by her arms and by her\\r\\nnegotiations, by force and by fraud, has, in different degrees, extended\\r\\nher dominion over them all. Africa, Asia, and America, have successively\\r\\nfelt her domination. The superiority she has long maintained has tempted\\r\\nher to plume herself as the Mistress of the World, and to consider the\\r\\nrest of mankind as created for her benefit. Men admired as profound\\r\\nphilosophers have, in direct terms, attributed to her inhabitants a\\r\\nphysical superiority, and have gravely asserted that all animals, and\\r\\nwith them the human species, degenerate in America--that even dogs cease\\r\\nto bark after having breathed awhile in our atmosphere.(1) Facts have\\r\\ntoo long supported these arrogant pretensions of the Europeans. It\\r\\nbelongs to us to vindicate the honor of the human race, and to teach\\r\\nthat assuming brother, moderation. Union will enable us to do it.\\r\\nDisunion will will add another victim to his triumphs. Let Americans\\r\\ndisdain to be the instruments of European greatness! Let the thirteen\\r\\nStates, bound together in a strict and indissoluble Union, concur in\\r\\nerecting one great American system, superior to the control of all\\r\\ntransatlantic force or influence, and able to dictate the terms of the\\r\\nconnection between the old and the new world!\\r\\n\\r\\nPUBLIUS \\\"Recherches philosophiques sur les Americains.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\", \"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Utility of the Union In Respect to Revenue\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the New York Packet. Tuesday, November 27, 1787.\\r\\n\\r\\nHAMILTON\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE effects of Union upon the commercial prosperity of the States have\\r\\nbeen sufficiently delineated. Its tendency to promote the interests of\\r\\nrevenue will be the subject of our present inquiry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prosperity of commerce is now perceived and acknowledged by\\r\\nall enlightened statesmen to be the most useful as well as the most\\r\\nproductive source of national wealth, and has accordingly become a\\r\\nprimary object of their political cares. By multiplying the means of\\r\\ngratification, by promoting the introduction and circulation of the\\r\\nprecious metals, those darling objects of human avarice and enterprise,\\r\\nit serves to vivify and invigorate the channels of industry, and to make\\r\\nthem flow with greater activity and copiousness. The assiduous merchant,\\r\\nthe laborious husbandman, the active mechanic, and the industrious\\r\\nmanufacturer,--all orders of men, look forward with eager expectation\\r\\nand growing alacrity to this pleasing reward of their toils. The\\r\\noften-agitated question between agriculture and commerce has, from\\r\\nindubitable experience, received a decision which has silenced the\\r\\nrivalship that once subsisted between them, and has proved, to the\\r\\nsatisfaction of their friends, that their interests are intimately\\r\\nblended and interwoven. It has been found in various countries that, in\\r\\nproportion as commerce has flourished, land has risen in value. And how\\r\\ncould it have happened otherwise? Could that which procures a freer vent\\r\\nfor the products of the earth, which furnishes new incitements to the\\r\\ncultivation of land, which is the most powerful instrument in increasing\\r\\nthe quantity of money in a state--could that, in fine, which is the\\r\\nfaithful handmaid of labor and industry, in every shape, fail to augment\\r\\nthat article, which is the prolific parent of far the greatest part\\r\\nof the objects upon which they are exerted? It is astonishing that so\\r\\nsimple a truth should ever have had an adversary; and it is one, among\\r\\na multitude of proofs, how apt a spirit of ill-informed jealousy, or\\r\\nof too great abstraction and refinement, is to lead men astray from the\\r\\nplainest truths of reason and conviction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ability of a country to pay taxes must always be proportioned, in\\r\\na great degree, to the quantity of money in circulation, and to the\\r\\ncelerity with which it circulates. Commerce, contributing to both these\\r\\nobjects, must of necessity render the payment of taxes easier, and\\r\\nfacilitate the requisite supplies to the treasury. The hereditary\\r\\ndominions of the Emperor of Germany contain a great extent of fertile,\\r\\ncultivated, and populous territory, a large proportion of which is\\r\\nsituated in mild and luxuriant climates. In some parts of this territory\\r\\nare to be found the best gold and silver mines in Europe. And yet, from\\r\\nthe want of the fostering influence of commerce, that monarch can\\r\\nboast but slender revenues. He has several times been compelled to\\r\\nowe obligations to the pecuniary succors of other nations for the\\r\\npreservation of his essential interests, and is unable, upon the\\r\\nstrength of his own resources, to sustain a long or continued war.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it is not in this aspect of the subject alone that Union will be\\r\\nseen to conduce to the purpose of revenue. There are other points of\\r\\nview, in which its influence will appear more immediate and decisive. It\\r\\nis evident from the state of the country, from the habits of the\\r\\npeople, from the experience we have had on the point itself, that it is\\r\\nimpracticable to raise any very considerable sums by direct taxation.\\r\\nTax laws have in vain been multiplied; new methods to enforce the\\r\\ncollection have in vain been tried; the public expectation has been\\r\\nuniformly disappointed, and the treasuries of the States have remained\\r\\nempty. The popular system of administration inherent in the nature of\\r\\npopular government, coinciding with the real scarcity of money incident\\r\\nto a languid and mutilated state of trade, has hitherto defeated every\\r\\nexperiment for extensive collections, and has at length taught the\\r\\ndifferent legislatures the folly of attempting them.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo person acquainted with what happens in other countries will be\\r\\nsurprised at this circumstance. In so opulent a nation as that of\\r\\nBritain, where direct taxes from superior wealth must be much more\\r\\ntolerable, and, from the vigor of the government, much more practicable,\\r\\nthan in America, far the greatest part of the national revenue is\\r\\nderived from taxes of the indirect kind, from imposts, and from\\r\\nexcises. Duties on imported articles form a large branch of this latter\\r\\ndescription.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn America, it is evident that we must a long time depend for the means\\r\\nof revenue chiefly on such duties. In most parts of it, excises must\\r\\nbe confined within a narrow compass. The genius of the people will ill\\r\\nbrook the inquisitive and peremptory spirit of excise laws. The pockets\\r\\nof the farmers, on the other hand, will reluctantly yield but scanty\\r\\nsupplies, in the unwelcome shape of impositions on their houses and\\r\\nlands; and personal property is too precarious and invisible a fund to\\r\\nbe laid hold of in any other way than by the imperceptible agency of\\r\\ntaxes on consumption.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf these remarks have any foundation, that state of things which will\\r\\nbest enable us to improve and extend so valuable a resource must be\\r\\nbest adapted to our political welfare. And it cannot admit of a serious\\r\\ndoubt, that this state of things must rest on the basis of a general\\r\\nUnion. As far as this would be conducive to the interests of commerce,\\r\\nso far it must tend to the extension of the revenue to be drawn from\\r\\nthat source. As far as it would contribute to rendering regulations for\\r\\nthe collection of the duties more simple and efficacious, so far it\\r\\nmust serve to answer the purposes of making the same rate of duties\\r\\nmore productive, and of putting it into the power of the government to\\r\\nincrease the rate without prejudice to trade.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe relative situation of these States; the number of rivers with which\\r\\nthey are intersected, and of bays that wash their shores; the facility\\r\\nof communication in every direction; the affinity of language\\r\\nand manners; the familiar habits of intercourse;--all these are\\r\\ncircumstances that would conspire to render an illicit trade between\\r\\nthem a matter of little difficulty, and would insure frequent evasions\\r\\nof the commercial regulations of each other. The separate States or\\r\\nconfederacies would be necessitated by mutual jealousy to avoid the\\r\\ntemptations to that kind of trade by the lowness of their duties. The\\r\\ntemper of our governments, for a long time to come, would not permit\\r\\nthose rigorous precautions by which the European nations guard the\\r\\navenues into their respective countries, as well by land as by\\r\\nwater; and which, even there, are found insufficient obstacles to the\\r\\nadventurous stratagems of avarice.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn France, there is an army of patrols (as they are called) constantly\\r\\nemployed to secure their fiscal regulations against the inroads of the\\r\\ndealers in contraband trade. Mr. Neckar computes the number of these\\r\\npatrols at upwards of twenty thousand. This shows the immense difficulty\\r\\nin preventing that species of traffic, where there is an inland\\r\\ncommunication, and places in a strong light the disadvantages with which\\r\\nthe collection of duties in this country would be encumbered, if by\\r\\ndisunion the States should be placed in a situation, with respect to\\r\\neach other, resembling that of France with respect to her neighbors. The\\r\\narbitrary and vexatious powers with which the patrols are necessarily\\r\\narmed, would be intolerable in a free country.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf, on the contrary, there be but one government pervading all the\\r\\nStates, there will be, as to the principal part of our commerce, but\\r\\nONE SIDE to guard--the ATLANTIC COAST. Vessels arriving directly from\\r\\nforeign countries, laden with valuable cargoes, would rarely choose to\\r\\nhazard themselves to the complicated and critical perils which would\\r\\nattend attempts to unlade prior to their coming into port. They would\\r\\nhave to dread both the dangers of the coast, and of detection, as well\\r\\nafter as before their arrival at the places of their final destination.\\r\\nAn ordinary degree of vigilance would be competent to the prevention\\r\\nof any material infractions upon the rights of the revenue. A few armed\\r\\nvessels, judiciously stationed at the entrances of our ports, might at\\r\\na small expense be made useful sentinels of the laws. And the government\\r\\nhaving the same interest to provide against violations everywhere,\\r\\nthe co-operation of its measures in each State would have a powerful\\r\\ntendency to render them effectual. Here also we should preserve by\\r\\nUnion, an advantage which nature holds out to us, and which would be\\r\\nrelinquished by separation. The United States lie at a great distance\\r\\nfrom Europe, and at a considerable distance from all other places\\r\\nwith which they would have extensive connections of foreign trade.\\r\\nThe passage from them to us, in a few hours, or in a single night,\\r\\nas between the coasts of France and Britain, and of other neighboring\\r\\nnations, would be impracticable. This is a prodigious security against a\\r\\ndirect contraband with foreign countries; but a circuitous contraband to\\r\\none State, through the medium of another, would be both easy and safe.\\r\\nThe difference between a direct importation from abroad, and an indirect\\r\\nimportation through the channel of a neighboring State, in small\\r\\nparcels, according to time and opportunity, with the additional\\r\\nfacilities of inland communication, must be palpable to every man of\\r\\ndiscernment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is therefore evident, that one national government would be able, at\\r\\nmuch less expense, to extend the duties on imports, beyond comparison,\\r\\nfurther than would be practicable to the States separately, or to any\\r\\npartial confederacies. Hitherto, I believe, it may safely be asserted,\\r\\nthat these duties have not upon an average exceeded in any State three\\r\\nper cent. In France they are estimated to be about fifteen per cent.,\\r\\nand in Britain they exceed this proportion.(1) There seems to be nothing\\r\\nto hinder their being increased in this country to at least treble their\\r\\npresent amount. The single article of ardent spirits, under federal\\r\\nregulation, might be made to furnish a considerable revenue. Upon a\\r\\nratio to the importation into this State, the whole quantity imported\\r\\ninto the United States may be estimated at four millions of gallons;\\r\\nwhich, at a shilling per gallon, would produce two hundred thousand\\r\\npounds. That article would well bear this rate of duty; and if it should\\r\\ntend to diminish the consumption of it, such an effect would be equally\\r\\nfavorable to the agriculture, to the economy, to the morals, and to the\\r\\nhealth of the society. There is, perhaps, nothing so much a subject of\\r\\nnational extravagance as these spirits.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat will be the consequence, if we are not able to avail ourselves of\\r\\nthe resource in question in its full extent? A nation cannot long exist\\r\\nwithout revenues. Destitute of this essential support, it must resign\\r\\nits independence, and sink into the degraded condition of a province.\\r\\nThis is an extremity to which no government will of choice accede.\\r\\nRevenue, therefore, must be had at all events. In this country, if the\\r\\nprincipal part be not drawn from commerce, it must fall with oppressive\\r\\nweight upon land. It has been already intimated that excises, in their\\r\\ntrue signification, are too little in unison with the feelings of the\\r\\npeople, to admit of great use being made of that mode of taxation; nor,\\r\\nindeed, in the States where almost the sole employment is agriculture,\\r\\nare the objects proper for excise sufficiently numerous to permit very\\r\\nample collections in that way. Personal estate (as has been before\\r\\nremarked), from the difficulty in tracing it, cannot be subjected to\\r\\nlarge contributions, by any other means than by taxes on consumption. In\\r\\npopulous cities, it may be enough the subject of conjecture, to occasion\\r\\nthe oppression of individuals, without much aggregate benefit to the\\r\\nState; but beyond these circles, it must, in a great measure, escape the\\r\\neye and the hand of the tax-gatherer. As the necessities of the State,\\r\\nnevertheless, must be satisfied in some mode or other, the defect of\\r\\nother resources must throw the principal weight of public burdens on\\r\\nthe possessors of land. And as, on the other hand, the wants of the\\r\\ngovernment can never obtain an adequate supply, unless all the sources\\r\\nof revenue are open to its demands, the finances of the community, under\\r\\nsuch embarrassments, cannot be put into a situation consistent with\\r\\nits respectability or its security. Thus we shall not even have the\\r\\nconsolations of a full treasury, to atone for the oppression of that\\r\\nvaluable class of the citizens who are employed in the cultivation of\\r\\nthe soil. But public and private distress will keep pace with each\\r\\nother in gloomy concert; and unite in deploring the infatuation of those\\r\\ncounsels which led to disunion.\\r\\n\\r\\nPUBLIUS\\r\\n\\r\\n1.

Wednesday, November 28, 1787\\r\\n\\r\\nHAMILTON\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\r\\n\\r\\nAs CONNECTED with the subject of revenue, we may with propriety consider\\r\\nthat of economy. The money saved from one object may be usefully applied\\r\\nto another, and there will be so much the less to be drawn from the\\r\\npockets of the people. If the States are united under one government,\\r\\nthere will be but one national civil list to support; if they are\\r\\ndivided into several confederacies, there will be as many different\\r\\nnational civil lists to be provided for--and each of them, as to the\\r\\nprincipal departments, coextensive with that which would be necessary\\r\\nfor a government of the whole. The entire separation of the States into\\r\\nthirteen unconnected sovereignties is a project too extravagant and\\r\\ntoo replete with danger to have many advocates. The ideas of men who\\r\\nspeculate upon the dismemberment of the empire seem generally turned\\r\\ntoward three confederacies--one consisting of the four Northern, another\\r\\nof the four Middle, and a third of the five Southern States. There is\\r\\nlittle probability that there would be a greater number. According\\r\\nto this distribution, each confederacy would comprise an extent\\r\\nof territory larger than that of the kingdom of Great Britain. No\\r\\nwell-informed man will suppose that the affairs of such a confederacy\\r\\ncan be properly regulated by a government less comprehensive in\\r\\nits organs or institutions than that which has been proposed by\\r\\nthe convention. When the dimensions of a State attain to a certain\\r\\nmagnitude, it requires the same energy of government and the same forms\\r\\nof administration which are requisite in one of much greater extent.\\r\\nThis idea admits not of precise demonstration, because there is no rule\\r\\nby which we can measure the momentum of civil power necessary to the\\r\\ngovernment of any given number of individuals; but when we consider that\\r\\nthe island of Britain, nearly commensurate with each of the supposed\\r\\nconfederacies, contains about eight millions of people, and when we\\r\\nreflect upon the degree of authority required to direct the passions of\\r\\nso large a society to the public good, we shall see no reason to doubt\\r\\nthat the like portion of power would be sufficient to perform the same\\r\\ntask in a society far more numerous. Civil power, properly organized and\\r\\nexerted, is capable of diffusing its force to a very great extent; and\\r\\ncan, in a manner, reproduce itself in every part of a great empire by a\\r\\njudicious arrangement of subordinate institutions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe supposition that each confederacy into which the States would be\\r\\nlikely to be divided would require a government not less comprehensive\\r\\nthan the one proposed, will be strengthened by another supposition, more\\r\\nprobable than that which presents us with three confederacies as the\\r\\nalternative to a general Union. If we attend carefully to geographical\\r\\nand commercial considerations, in conjunction with the habits and\\r\\nprejudices of the different States, we shall be led to conclude that in\\r\\ncase of disunion they will most naturally league themselves under two\\r\\ngovernments. The four Eastern States, from all the causes that form\\r\\nthe links of national sympathy and connection, may with certainty be\\r\\nexpected to unite. New York, situated as she is, would never be unwise\\r\\nenough to oppose a feeble and unsupported flank to the weight of that\\r\\nconfederacy. There are other obvious reasons that would facilitate her\\r\\naccession to it. New Jersey is too small a State to think of being a\\r\\nfrontier, in opposition to this still more powerful combination; nor\\r\\ndo there appear to be any obstacles to her admission into it. Even\\r\\nPennsylvania would have strong inducements to join the Northern league.\\r\\nAn active foreign commerce, on the basis of her own navigation, is her\\r\\ntrue policy, and coincides with the opinions and dispositions of her\\r\\ncitizens. The more Southern States, from various circumstances, may not\\r\\nthink themselves much interested in the encouragement of navigation.\\r\\nThey may prefer a system which would give unlimited scope to all nations\\r\\nto be the carriers as well as the purchasers of their commodities.\\r\\nPennsylvania may not choose to confound her interests in a connection so\\r\\nadverse to her policy. As she must at all events be a frontier, she may\\r\\ndeem it most consistent with her safety to have her exposed side turned\\r\\ntowards the weaker power of the Southern, rather than towards the\\r\\nstronger power of the Northern, Confederacy. This would give her the\\r\\nfairest chance to avoid being the Flanders of America. Whatever may be\\r\\nthe determination of Pennsylvania, if the Northern Confederacy includes\\r\\nNew Jersey, there is no likelihood of more than one confederacy to the\\r\\nsouth of that State.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing can be more evident than that the thirteen States will be able\\r\\nto support a national government better than one half, or one third, or\\r\\nany number less than the whole. This reflection must have great weight\\r\\nin obviating that objection to the proposed plan, which is founded on\\r\\nthe principle of expense; an objection, however, which, when we come\\r\\nto take a nearer view of it, will appear in every light to stand on\\r\\nmistaken ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf, in addition to the consideration of a plurality of civil lists, we\\r\\ntake into view the number of persons who must necessarily be employed\\r\\nto guard the inland communication between the different confederacies\\r\\nagainst illicit trade, and who in time will infallibly spring up out of\\r\\nthe necessities of revenue; and if we also take into view the military\\r\\nestablishments which it has been shown would unavoidably result from the\\r\\njealousies and conflicts of the several nations into which the States\\r\\nwould be divided, we shall clearly discover that a separation would be\\r\\nnot less injurious to the economy, than to the tranquillity, commerce,\\r\\nrevenue, and liberty of every part.\\r\\n\\r\\nPUBLIUS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\", \"\\r\\n\\r\\nObjections to the Proposed Constitution From Extent of Territory\\r\\nAnswered\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the New York Packet. Friday, November 30, 1787.\\r\\n\\r\\nMADISON\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\r\\n\\r\\nWE HAVE seen the necessity of the Union, as our bulwark against foreign\\r\\ndanger, as the conservator of peace among ourselves, as the guardian\\r\\nof our commerce and other common interests, as the only substitute for\\r\\nthose military establishments which have subverted the liberties of the\\r\\nOld World, and as the proper antidote for the diseases of faction, which\\r\\nhave proved fatal to other popular governments, and of which alarming\\r\\nsymptoms have been betrayed by our own. All that remains, within this\\r\\nbranch of our inquiries, is to take notice of an objection that may be\\r\\ndrawn from the great extent of country which the Union embraces. A few\\r\\nobservations on this subject will be the more proper, as it is perceived\\r\\nthat the adversaries of the new Constitution are availing themselves\\r\\nof the prevailing prejudice with regard to the practicable sphere\\r\\nof republican administration, in order to supply, by imaginary\\r\\ndifficulties, the want of those solid objections which they endeavor in\\r\\nvain to find.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe error which limits republican government to a narrow district has\\r\\nbeen unfolded and refuted in preceding papers. I remark here only that\\r\\nit seems to owe its rise and prevalence chiefly to the confounding of a\\r\\nrepublic with a democracy, applying to the former reasonings drawn from\\r\\nthe nature of the latter. The true distinction between these forms was\\r\\nalso adverted to on a former occasion. It is, that in a democracy, the\\r\\npeople meet and exercise the government in person; in a republic,\\r\\nthey assemble and administer it by their representatives and agents. A\\r\\ndemocracy, consequently, will be confined to a small spot. A republic\\r\\nmay be extended over a large region.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this accidental source of the error may be added the artifice of some\\r\\ncelebrated authors, whose writings have had a great share in forming\\r\\nthe modern standard of political opinions. Being subjects either of\\r\\nan absolute or limited monarchy, they have endeavored to heighten\\r\\nthe advantages, or palliate the evils of those forms, by placing in\\r\\ncomparison the vices and defects of the republican, and by citing as\\r\\nspecimens of the latter the turbulent democracies of ancient Greece and\\r\\nmodern Italy. Under the confusion of names, it has been an easy task to\\r\\ntransfer to a republic observations applicable to a democracy only; and\\r\\namong others, the observation that it can never be established but among\\r\\na small number of people, living within a small compass of territory.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch a fallacy may have been the less perceived, as most of the popular\\r\\ngovernments of antiquity were of the democratic species; and even in\\r\\nmodern Europe, to which we owe the great principle of representation, no\\r\\nexample is seen of a government wholly popular, and founded, at the same\\r\\ntime, wholly on that principle. If Europe has the merit of discovering\\r\\nthis great mechanical power in government, by the simple agency of which\\r\\nthe will of the largest political body may be concentred, and its force\\r\\ndirected to any object which the public good requires, America can claim\\r\\nthe merit of making the discovery the basis of unmixed and extensive\\r\\nrepublics. It is only to be lamented that any of her citizens should\\r\\nwish to deprive her of the additional merit of displaying its full\\r\\nefficacy in the establishment of the comprehensive system now under her\\r\\nconsideration.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the natural limit of a democracy is that distance from the central\\r\\npoint which will just permit the most remote citizens to assemble as\\r\\noften as their public functions demand, and will include no greater\\r\\nnumber than can join in those functions; so the natural limit of a\\r\\nrepublic is that distance from the centre which will barely allow\\r\\nthe representatives to meet as often as may be necessary for the\\r\\nadministration of public affairs. Can it be said that the limits of the\\r\\nUnited States exceed this distance? It will not be said by those who\\r\\nrecollect that the Atlantic coast is the longest side of the Union, that\\r\\nduring the term of thirteen years, the representatives of the States\\r\\nhave been almost continually assembled, and that the members from the\\r\\nmost distant States are not chargeable with greater intermissions of\\r\\nattendance than those from the States in the neighborhood of Congress.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat we may form a juster estimate with regard to this interesting\\r\\nsubject, let us resort to the actual dimensions of the Union. The\\r\\nlimits, as fixed by the treaty of peace, are: on the east the Atlantic,\\r\\non the south the latitude of thirty-one degrees, on the west the\\r\\nMississippi, and on the north an irregular line running in some\\r\\ninstances beyond the forty-fifth degree, in others falling as low as the\\r\\nforty-second. The southern shore of Lake Erie lies below that latitude.\\r\\nComputing the distance between the thirty-first and forty-fifth degrees,\\r\\nit amounts to nine hundred and seventy-three common miles; computing it\\r\\nfrom thirty-one to forty-two degrees, to seven hundred and sixty-four\\r\\nmiles and a half. Taking the mean for the distance, the amount will be\\r\\neight hundred and sixty-eight miles and three-fourths. The mean distance\\r\\nfrom the Atlantic to the Mississippi does not probably exceed seven\\r\\nhundred and fifty miles. On a comparison of this extent with that of\\r\\nseveral countries in Europe, the practicability of rendering our system\\r\\ncommensurate to it appears to be demonstrable. It is not a great deal\\r\\nlarger than Germany, where a diet representing the whole empire is\\r\\ncontinually assembled; or than Poland before the late dismemberment,\\r\\nwhere another national diet was the depositary of the supreme power.\\r\\nPassing by France and Spain, we find that in Great Britain, inferior as\\r\\nit may be in size, the representatives of the northern extremity of the\\r\\nisland have as far to travel to the national council as will be required\\r\\nof those of the most remote parts of the Union.\\r\\n\\r\\nFavorable as this view of the subject may be, some observations remain\\r\\nwhich will place it in a light still more satisfactory.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first place it is to be remembered that the general government is\\r\\nnot to be charged with the whole power of making and administering laws.\\r\\nIts jurisdiction is limited to certain enumerated objects, which concern\\r\\nall the members of the republic, but which are not to be attained by\\r\\nthe separate provisions of any. The subordinate governments, which can\\r\\nextend their care to all those other subjects which can be separately\\r\\nprovided for, will retain their due authority and activity. Were it\\r\\nproposed by the plan of the convention to abolish the governments of\\r\\nthe particular States, its adversaries would have some ground for their\\r\\nobjection; though it would not be difficult to show that if they were\\r\\nabolished the general government would be compelled, by the principle of\\r\\nself-preservation, to reinstate them in their proper jurisdiction.\\r\\n\\r\\nA second observation to be made is that the immediate object of the\\r\\nfederal Constitution is to secure the union of the thirteen primitive\\r\\nStates, which we know to be practicable; and to add to them such other\\r\\nStates as may arise in their own bosoms, or in their neighborhoods,\\r\\nwhich we cannot doubt to be equally practicable. The arrangements that\\r\\nmay be necessary for those angles and fractions of our territory which\\r\\nlie on our northwestern frontier, must be left to those whom further\\r\\ndiscoveries and experience will render more equal to the task.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet it be remarked, in the third place, that the intercourse throughout\\r\\nthe Union will be facilitated by new improvements. Roads will everywhere\\r\\nbe shortened, and kept in better order; accommodations for travelers\\r\\nwill be multiplied and meliorated; an interior navigation on our eastern\\r\\nside will be opened throughout, or nearly throughout, the whole extent\\r\\nof the thirteen States. The communication between the Western and\\r\\nAtlantic districts, and between different parts of each, will be\\r\\nrendered more and more easy by those numerous canals with which the\\r\\nbeneficence of nature has intersected our country, and which art finds\\r\\nit so little difficult to connect and complete.\\r\\n\\r\\nA fourth and still more important consideration is, that as almost every\\r\\nState will, on one side or other, be a frontier, and will thus find, in\\r\\nregard to its safety, an inducement to make some sacrifices for the\\r\\nsake of the general protection; so the States which lie at the greatest\\r\\ndistance from the heart of the Union, and which, of course, may partake\\r\\nleast of the ordinary circulation of its benefits, will be at the same\\r\\ntime immediately contiguous to foreign nations, and will consequently\\r\\nstand, on particular occasions, in greatest need of its strength and\\r\\nresources. It may be inconvenient for Georgia, or the States forming our\\r\\nwestern or northeastern borders, to send their representatives to the\\r\\nseat of government; but they would find it more so to struggle alone\\r\\nagainst an invading enemy, or even to support alone the whole expense of\\r\\nthose precautions which may be dictated by the neighborhood of continual\\r\\ndanger. If they should derive less benefit, therefore, from the Union\\r\\nin some respects than the less distant States, they will derive greater\\r\\nbenefit from it in other respects, and thus the proper equilibrium will\\r\\nbe maintained throughout.\\r\\n\\r\\nI submit to you, my fellow-citizens, these considerations, in full\\r\\nconfidence that the good sense which has so often marked your decisions\\r\\nwill allow them their due weight and effect; and that you will never\\r\\nsuffer difficulties, however formidable in appearance, or however\\r\\nfashionable the error on which they may be founded, to drive you into\\r\\nthe gloomy and perilous scene into which the advocates for disunion\\r\\nwould conduct you. Hearken not to the unnatural voice which tells you\\r\\nthat the people of America, knit together as they are by so many cords\\r\\nof affection, can no longer live together as members of the same family;\\r\\ncan no longer continue the mutual guardians of their mutual happiness;\\r\\ncan no longer be fellow citizens of one great, respectable, and\\r\\nflourishing empire. Hearken not to the voice which petulantly tells you\\r\\nthat the form of government recommended for your adoption is a novelty\\r\\nin the political world; that it has never yet had a place in the\\r\\ntheories of the wildest projectors; that it rashly attempts what it is\\r\\nimpossible to accomplish. No, my countrymen, shut your ears against\\r\\nthis unhallowed language. Shut your hearts against the poison which\\r\\nit conveys; the kindred blood which flows in the veins of American\\r\\ncitizens, the mingled blood which they have shed in defense of their\\r\\nsacred rights, consecrate their Union, and excite horror at the idea\\r\\nof their becoming aliens, rivals, enemies. And if novelties are to be\\r\\nshunned, believe me, the most alarming of all novelties, the most wild\\r\\nof all projects, the most rash of all attempts, is that of rendering us\\r\\nin pieces, in order to preserve our liberties and promote our happiness.\\r\\nBut why is the experiment of an extended republic to be rejected, merely\\r\\nbecause it may comprise what is new? Is it not the glory of the people\\r\\nof America, that, whilst they have paid a decent regard to the opinions\\r\\nof former times and other nations, they have not suffered a blind\\r\\nveneration for antiquity, for custom, or for names, to overrule\\r\\nthe suggestions of their own good sense, the knowledge of their own\\r\\nsituation, and the lessons of their own experience? To this manly\\r\\nspirit, posterity will be indebted for the possession, and the world\\r\\nfor the example, of the numerous innovations displayed on the American\\r\\ntheatre, in favor of private rights and public happiness. Had no\\r\\nimportant step been taken by the leaders of the Revolution for which a\\r\\nprecedent could not be discovered, no government established of which\\r\\nan exact model did not present itself, the people of the United States\\r\\nmight, at this moment have been numbered among the melancholy victims of\\r\\nmisguided councils, must at best have been laboring under the weight\\r\\nof some of those forms which have crushed the liberties of the rest of\\r\\nmankind. Happily for America, happily, we trust, for the whole human\\r\\nrace, they pursued a new and more noble course. They accomplished a\\r\\nrevolution which has no parallel in the annals of human society. They\\r\\nreared the fabrics of governments which have no model on the face of\\r\\nthe globe. They formed the design of a great Confederacy, which it is\\r\\nincumbent on their successors to improve and perpetuate. If their works\\r\\nbetray imperfections, we wonder at the fewness of them. If they erred\\r\\nmost in the structure of the Union, this was the work most difficult to\\r\\nbe executed; this is the work which has been new modelled by the act of\\r\\nyour convention, and it is that act on which you are now to deliberate\\r\\nand to decide.\\r\\n\\r\\nPUBLIUS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\", \"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Insufficiency of the Present Confederation to Preserve the Union\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the Independent Journal. Saturday, December 1, 1787\\r\\n\\r\\nHAMILTON\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\r\\n\\r\\nIN THE course of the preceding papers, I have endeavored, my fellow\\r\\ncitizens, to place before you, in a clear and convincing light, the\\r\\nimportance of Union to your political safety and happiness. I have\\r\\nunfolded to you a complication of dangers to which you would be exposed,\\r\\nshould you permit that sacred knot which binds the people of America\\r\\ntogether be severed or dissolved by ambition or by avarice, by jealousy\\r\\nor by misrepresentation. In the sequel of the inquiry through which\\r\\nI propose to accompany you, the truths intended to be inculcated\\r\\nwill receive further confirmation from facts and arguments hitherto\\r\\nunnoticed. If the road over which you will still have to pass should in\\r\\nsome places appear to you tedious or irksome, you will recollect that\\r\\nyou are in quest of information on a subject the most momentous which\\r\\ncan engage the attention of a free people, that the field through which\\r\\nyou have to travel is in itself spacious, and that the difficulties of\\r\\nthe journey have been unnecessarily increased by the mazes with which\\r\\nsophistry has beset the way. It will be my aim to remove the obstacles\\r\\nfrom your progress in as compendious a manner as it can be done, without\\r\\nsacrificing utility to despatch.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn pursuance of the plan which I have laid down for the discussion\\r\\nof the subject, the point next in order to be examined is the\\r\\n\\\"insufficiency of the present Confederation to the preservation of the\\r\\nUnion.\\\" It may perhaps be asked what need there is of reasoning or proof\\r\\nto illustrate a position which is not either controverted or doubted, to\\r\\nwhich the understandings and feelings of all classes of men assent,\\r\\nand which in substance is admitted by the opponents as well as by the\\r\\nfriends of the new Constitution. It must in truth be acknowledged that,\\r\\nhowever these may differ in other respects, they in general appear\\r\\nto harmonize in this sentiment, at least, that there are material\\r\\nimperfections in our national system, and that something is necessary to\\r\\nbe done to rescue us from impending anarchy. The facts that support\\r\\nthis opinion are no longer objects of speculation. They have forced\\r\\nthemselves upon the sensibility of the people at large, and have at\\r\\nlength extorted from those, whose mistaken policy has had the principal\\r\\nshare in precipitating the extremity at which we are arrived, a\\r\\nreluctant confession of the reality of those defects in the scheme of\\r\\nour federal government, which have been long pointed out and regretted\\r\\nby the intelligent friends of the Union.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may indeed with propriety be said to have reached almost the last\\r\\nstage of national humiliation. There is scarcely anything that can wound\\r\\nthe pride or degrade the character of an independent nation which we do\\r\\nnot experience. Are there engagements to the performance of which we\\r\\nare held by every tie respectable among men? These are the subjects of\\r\\nconstant and unblushing violation. Do we owe debts to foreigners and\\r\\nto our own citizens contracted in a time of imminent peril for the\\r\\npreservation of our political existence? These remain without any\\r\\nproper or satisfactory provision for their discharge. Have we valuable\\r\\nterritories and important posts in the possession of a foreign\\r\\npower which, by express stipulations, ought long since to have\\r\\nbeen surrendered? These are still retained, to the prejudice of our\\r\\ninterests, not less than of our rights. Are we in a condition to resent\\r\\nor to repel the aggression? We have neither troops, nor treasury, nor\\r\\ngovernment.(1) Are we even in a condition to remonstrate with dignity?\\r\\nThe just imputations on our own faith, in respect to the same treaty,\\r\\nought first to be removed. Are we entitled by nature and compact to a\\r\\nfree participation in the navigation of the Mississippi? Spain excludes\\r\\nus from it. Is public credit an indispensable resource in time of\\r\\npublic danger? We seem to have abandoned its cause as desperate and\\r\\nirretrievable. Is commerce of importance to national wealth? Ours is at\\r\\nthe lowest point of declension. Is respectability in the eyes of foreign\\r\\npowers a safeguard against foreign encroachments? The imbecility of our\\r\\ngovernment even forbids them to treat with us. Our ambassadors abroad\\r\\nare the mere pageants of mimic sovereignty. Is a violent and unnatural\\r\\ndecrease in the value of land a symptom of national distress? The price\\r\\nof improved land in most parts of the country is much lower than can be\\r\\naccounted for by the quantity of waste land at market, and can only be\\r\\nfully explained by that want of private and public confidence, which\\r\\nare so alarmingly prevalent among all ranks, and which have a direct\\r\\ntendency to depreciate property of every kind. Is private credit the\\r\\nfriend and patron of industry? That most useful kind which relates to\\r\\nborrowing and lending is reduced within the narrowest limits, and this\\r\\nstill more from an opinion of insecurity than from the scarcity of\\r\\nmoney. To shorten an enumeration of particulars which can afford neither\\r\\npleasure nor instruction, it may in general be demanded, what indication\\r\\nis there of national disorder, poverty, and insignificance that could\\r\\nbefall a community so peculiarly blessed with natural advantages as\\r\\nwe are, which does not form a part of the dark catalogue of our public\\r\\nmisfortunes?\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the melancholy situation to which we have been brought by those\\r\\nvery maxims and councils which would now deter us from adopting the\\r\\nproposed Constitution; and which, not content with having conducted us\\r\\nto the brink of a precipice, seem resolved to plunge us into the abyss\\r\\nthat awaits us below. Here, my countrymen, impelled by every motive that\\r\\nought to influence an enlightened people, let us make a firm stand for\\r\\nour safety, our tranquillity, our dignity, our reputation. Let us at\\r\\nlast break the fatal charm which has too long seduced us from the paths\\r\\nof felicity and prosperity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is true, as has been before observed that facts, too stubborn to\\r\\nbe resisted, have produced a species of general assent to the abstract\\r\\nproposition that there exist material defects in our national system;\\r\\nbut the usefulness of the concession, on the part of the old adversaries\\r\\nof federal measures, is destroyed by a strenuous opposition to a remedy,\\r\\nupon the only principles that can give it a chance of success. While\\r\\nthey admit that the government of the United States is destitute of\\r\\nenergy, they contend against conferring upon it those powers which\\r\\nare requisite to supply that energy. They seem still to aim at things\\r\\nrepugnant and irreconcilable; at an augmentation of federal authority,\\r\\nwithout a diminution of State authority; at sovereignty in the Union,\\r\\nand complete independence in the members. They still, in fine, seem\\r\\nto cherish with blind devotion the political monster of an imperium in\\r\\nimperio. This renders a full display of the principal defects of the\\r\\nConfederation necessary, in order to show that the evils we experience\\r\\ndo not proceed from minute or partial imperfections, but from\\r\\nfundamental errors in the structure of the building, which cannot be\\r\\namended otherwise than by an alteration in the first principles and main\\r\\npillars of the fabric.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great and radical vice in the construction of the existing\\r\\nConfederation is in the principle of LEGISLATION for STATES or\\r\\nGOVERNMENTS, in their CORPORATE or COLLECTIVE CAPACITIES, and as\\r\\ncontradistinguished from the INDIVIDUALS of which they consist. Though\\r\\nthis principle does not run through all the powers delegated to the\\r\\nUnion, yet it pervades and governs those on which the efficacy of the\\r\\nrest depends. Except as to the rule of appointment, the United States\\r\\nhas an indefinite discretion to make requisitions for men and money; but\\r\\nthey have no authority to raise either, by regulations extending to the\\r\\nindividual citizens of America. The consequence of this is, that\\r\\nthough in theory their resolutions concerning those objects are laws,\\r\\nconstitutionally binding on the members of the Union, yet in practice\\r\\nthey are mere recommendations which the States observe or disregard at\\r\\ntheir option.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a singular instance of the capriciousness of the human mind, that\\r\\nafter all the admonitions we have had from experience on this head,\\r\\nthere should still be found men who object to the new Constitution, for\\r\\ndeviating from a principle which has been found the bane of the old, and\\r\\nwhich is in itself evidently incompatible with the idea of GOVERNMENT;\\r\\na principle, in short, which, if it is to be executed at all, must\\r\\nsubstitute the violent and sanguinary agency of the sword to the mild\\r\\ninfluence of the magistracy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is nothing absurd or impracticable in the idea of a league or\\r\\nalliance between independent nations for certain defined purposes\\r\\nprecisely stated in a treaty regulating all the details of time, place,\\r\\ncircumstance, and quantity; leaving nothing to future discretion; and\\r\\ndepending for its execution on the good faith of the parties. Compacts\\r\\nof this kind exist among all civilized nations, subject to the usual\\r\\nvicissitudes of peace and war, of observance and non-observance, as the\\r\\ninterests or passions of the contracting powers dictate. In the early\\r\\npart of the present century there was an epidemical rage in Europe for\\r\\nthis species of compacts, from which the politicians of the times\\r\\nfondly hoped for benefits which were never realized. With a view to\\r\\nestablishing the equilibrium of power and the peace of that part of the\\r\\nworld, all the resources of negotiation were exhausted, and triple and\\r\\nquadruple alliances were formed; but they were scarcely formed before\\r\\nthey were broken, giving an instructive but afflicting lesson to\\r\\nmankind, how little dependence is to be placed on treaties which have\\r\\nno other sanction than the obligations of good faith, and which oppose\\r\\ngeneral considerations of peace and justice to the impulse of any\\r\\nimmediate interest or passion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the particular States in this country are disposed to stand in a\\r\\nsimilar relation to each other, and to drop the project of a general\\r\\nDISCRETIONARY SUPERINTENDENCE, the scheme would indeed be pernicious,\\r\\nand would entail upon us all the mischiefs which have been enumerated\\r\\nunder the first head; but it would have the merit of being, at least,\\r\\nconsistent and practicable Abandoning all views towards a confederate\\r\\ngovernment, this would bring us to a simple alliance offensive and\\r\\ndefensive; and would place us in a situation to be alternate friends\\r\\nand enemies of each other, as our mutual jealousies and rivalships,\\r\\nnourished by the intrigues of foreign nations, should prescribe to us.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if we are unwilling to be placed in this perilous situation; if we\\r\\nstill will adhere to the design of a national government, or, which\\r\\nis the same thing, of a superintending power, under the direction of\\r\\na common council, we must resolve to incorporate into our plan those\\r\\ningredients which may be considered as forming the characteristic\\r\\ndifference between a league and a government; we must extend the\\r\\nauthority of the Union to the persons of the citizens,--the only proper\\r\\nobjects of government.\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernment implies the power of making laws. It is essential to the idea\\r\\nof a law, that it be attended with a sanction; or, in other words, a\\r\\npenalty or punishment for disobedience. If there be no penalty annexed\\r\\nto disobedience, the resolutions or commands which pretend to be laws\\r\\nwill, in fact, amount to nothing more than advice or recommendation.\\r\\nThis penalty, whatever it may be, can only be inflicted in two ways: by\\r\\nthe agency of the courts and ministers of justice, or by military force;\\r\\nby the COERCION of the magistracy, or by the COERCION of arms. The first\\r\\nkind can evidently apply only to men; the last kind must of necessity,\\r\\nbe employed against bodies politic, or communities, or States. It is\\r\\nevident that there is no process of a court by which the observance\\r\\nof the laws can, in the last resort, be enforced. Sentences may be\\r\\ndenounced against them for violations of their duty; but these sentences\\r\\ncan only be carried into execution by the sword. In an association\\r\\nwhere the general authority is confined to the collective bodies of the\\r\\ncommunities, that compose it, every breach of the laws must involve a\\r\\nstate of war; and military execution must become the only instrument of\\r\\ncivil obedience. Such a state of things can certainly not deserve the\\r\\nname of government, nor would any prudent man choose to commit his\\r\\nhappiness to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a time when we were told that breaches, by the States, of the\\r\\nregulations of the federal authority were not to be expected; that\\r\\na sense of common interest would preside over the conduct of the\\r\\nrespective members, and would beget a full compliance with all the\\r\\nconstitutional requisitions of the Union. This language, at the present\\r\\nday, would appear as wild as a great part of what we now hear from\\r\\nthe same quarter will be thought, when we shall have received further\\r\\nlessons from that best oracle of wisdom, experience. It at all times\\r\\nbetrayed an ignorance of the true springs by which human conduct is\\r\\nactuated, and belied the original inducements to the establishment of\\r\\ncivil power. Why has government been instituted at all? Because the\\r\\npassions of men will not conform to the dictates of reason and justice,\\r\\nwithout constraint. Has it been found that bodies of men act with more\\r\\nrectitude or greater disinterestedness than individuals? The contrary\\r\\nof this has been inferred by all accurate observers of the conduct of\\r\\nmankind; and the inference is founded upon obvious reasons. Regard to\\r\\nreputation has a less active influence, when the infamy of a bad action\\r\\nis to be divided among a number than when it is to fall singly upon\\r\\none. A spirit of faction, which is apt to mingle its poison in the\\r\\ndeliberations of all bodies of men, will often hurry the persons of whom\\r\\nthey are composed into improprieties and excesses, for which they would\\r\\nblush in a private capacity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to all this, there is, in the nature of sovereign power,\\r\\nan impatience of control, that disposes those who are invested with the\\r\\nexercise of it, to look with an evil eye upon all external attempts to\\r\\nrestrain or direct its operations. From this spirit it happens, that\\r\\nin every political association which is formed upon the principle of\\r\\nuniting in a common interest a number of lesser sovereignties, there\\r\\nwill be found a kind of eccentric tendency in the subordinate or\\r\\ninferior orbs, by the operation of which there will be a perpetual\\r\\neffort in each to fly off from the common centre. This tendency is not\\r\\ndifficult to be accounted for. It has its origin in the love of power.\\r\\nPower controlled or abridged is almost always the rival and enemy\\r\\nof that power by which it is controlled or abridged. This simple\\r\\nproposition will teach us how little reason there is to expect, that\\r\\nthe persons intrusted with the administration of the affairs of the\\r\\nparticular members of a confederacy will at all times be ready, with\\r\\nperfect good-humor, and an unbiased regard to the public weal, to\\r\\nexecute the resolutions or decrees of the general authority. The reverse\\r\\nof this results from the constitution of human nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf, therefore, the measures of the Confederacy cannot be executed\\r\\nwithout the intervention of the particular administrations, there will\\r\\nbe little prospect of their being executed at all. The rulers of the\\r\\nrespective members, whether they have a constitutional right to do it\\r\\nor not, will undertake to judge of the propriety of the measures\\r\\nthemselves. They will consider the conformity of the thing proposed\\r\\nor required to their immediate interests or aims; the momentary\\r\\nconveniences or inconveniences that would attend its adoption. All this\\r\\nwill be done; and in a spirit of interested and suspicious scrutiny,\\r\\nwithout that knowledge of national circumstances and reasons of\\r\\nstate, which is essential to a right judgment, and with that strong\\r\\npredilection in favor of local objects, which can hardly fail to mislead\\r\\nthe decision. The same process must be repeated in every member of which\\r\\nthe body is constituted; and the execution of the plans, framed by the\\r\\ncouncils of the whole, will always fluctuate on the discretion of the\\r\\nill-informed and prejudiced opinion of every part. Those who have been\\r\\nconversant in the proceedings of popular assemblies; who have seen\\r\\nhow difficult it often is, where there is no exterior pressure of\\r\\ncircumstances, to bring them to harmonious resolutions on important\\r\\npoints, will readily conceive how impossible it must be to induce a\\r\\nnumber of such assemblies, deliberating at a distance from each other,\\r\\nat different times, and under different impressions, long to co-operate\\r\\nin the same views and pursuits.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn our case, the concurrence of thirteen distinct sovereign wills is\\r\\nrequisite, under the Confederation, to the complete execution of every\\r\\nimportant measure that proceeds from the Union. It has happened as was\\r\\nto have been foreseen. The measures of the Union have not been executed;\\r\\nthe delinquencies of the States have, step by step, matured themselves\\r\\nto an extreme, which has, at length, arrested all the wheels of the\\r\\nnational government, and brought them to an awful stand. Congress\\r\\nat this time scarcely possess the means of keeping up the forms of\\r\\nadministration, till the States can have time to agree upon a more\\r\\nsubstantial substitute for the present shadow of a federal government.\\r\\nThings did not come to this desperate extremity at once. The\\r\\ncauses which have been specified produced at first only unequal and\\r\\ndisproportionate degrees of compliance with the requisitions of the\\r\\nUnion. The greater deficiencies of some States furnished the pretext of\\r\\nexample and the temptation of interest to the complying, or to the least\\r\\ndelinquent States. Why should we do more in proportion than those who\\r\\nare embarked with us in the same political voyage? Why should we consent\\r\\nto bear more than our proper share of the common burden? These were\\r\\nsuggestions which human selfishness could not withstand, and which even\\r\\nspeculative men, who looked forward to remote consequences, could not,\\r\\nwithout hesitation, combat. Each State, yielding to the persuasive voice\\r\\nof immediate interest or convenience, has successively withdrawn its\\r\\nsupport, till the frail and tottering edifice seems ready to fall upon\\r\\nour heads, and to crush us beneath its ruins.\\r\\n\\r\\nPUBLIUS\\r\\n\\r\\n1. \\\"I mean for the Union.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\", \"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Same Subject Continued (The Insufficiency of the Present\\r\\nConfederation to Preserve the Union)\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the New York Packet. Tuesday, December 4, 1787.\\r\\n\\r\\nHAMILTON\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE tendency of the principle of legislation for States, or communities,\\r\\nin their political capacities, as it has been exemplified by the\\r\\nexperiment we have made of it, is equally attested by the events which\\r\\nhave befallen all other governments of the confederate kind, of which\\r\\nwe have any account, in exact proportion to its prevalence in those\\r\\nsystems. The confirmations of this fact will be worthy of a distinct\\r\\nand particular examination. I shall content myself with barely observing\\r\\nhere, that of all the confederacies of antiquity, which history has\\r\\nhanded down to us, the Lycian and Achaean leagues, as far as there\\r\\nremain vestiges of them, appear to have been most free from the fetters\\r\\nof that mistaken principle, and were accordingly those which have best\\r\\ndeserved, and have most liberally received, the applauding suffrages of\\r\\npolitical writers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis exceptionable principle may, as truly as emphatically, be styled\\r\\nthe parent of anarchy: It has been seen that delinquencies in the\\r\\nmembers of the Union are its natural and necessary offspring; and that\\r\\nwhenever they happen, the only constitutional remedy is force, and the\\r\\nimmediate effect of the use of it, civil war.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt remains to inquire how far so odious an engine of government, in its\\r\\napplication to us, would even be capable of answering its end. If there\\r\\nshould not be a large army constantly at the disposal of the national\\r\\ngovernment it would either not be able to employ force at all, or,\\r\\nwhen this could be done, it would amount to a war between parts of\\r\\nthe Confederacy concerning the infractions of a league, in which the\\r\\nstrongest combination would be most likely to prevail, whether it\\r\\nconsisted of those who supported or of those who resisted the general\\r\\nauthority. It would rarely happen that the delinquency to be redressed\\r\\nwould be confined to a single member, and if there were more than one\\r\\nwho had neglected their duty, similarity of situation would induce them\\r\\nto unite for common defense. Independent of this motive of sympathy, if\\r\\na large and influential State should happen to be the aggressing member,\\r\\nit would commonly have weight enough with its neighbors to win over some\\r\\nof them as associates to its cause. Specious arguments of danger to\\r\\nthe common liberty could easily be contrived; plausible excuses for\\r\\nthe deficiencies of the party could, without difficulty, be invented\\r\\nto alarm the apprehensions, inflame the passions, and conciliate the\\r\\ngood-will, even of those States which were not chargeable with any\\r\\nviolation or omission of duty. This would be the more likely to take\\r\\nplace, as the delinquencies of the larger members might be expected\\r\\nsometimes to proceed from an ambitious premeditation in their rulers,\\r\\nwith a view to getting rid of all external control upon their designs\\r\\nof personal aggrandizement; the better to effect which it is presumable\\r\\nthey would tamper beforehand with leading individuals in the adjacent\\r\\nStates. If associates could not be found at home, recourse would be\\r\\nhad to the aid of foreign powers, who would seldom be disinclined to\\r\\nencouraging the dissensions of a Confederacy, from the firm union\\r\\nof which they had so much to fear. When the sword is once drawn, the\\r\\npassions of men observe no bounds of moderation. The suggestions of\\r\\nwounded pride, the instigations of irritated resentment, would be apt\\r\\nto carry the States against which the arms of the Union were exerted, to\\r\\nany extremes necessary to avenge the affront or to avoid the disgrace\\r\\nof submission. The first war of this kind would probably terminate in a\\r\\ndissolution of the Union.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis may be considered as the violent death of the Confederacy. Its more\\r\\nnatural death is what we now seem to be on the point of experiencing, if\\r\\nthe federal system be not speedily renovated in a more substantial form.\\r\\nIt is not probable, considering the genius of this country, that the\\r\\ncomplying States would often be inclined to support the authority of the\\r\\nUnion by engaging in a war against the non-complying States. They would\\r\\nalways be more ready to pursue the milder course of putting themselves\\r\\nupon an equal footing with the delinquent members by an imitation of\\r\\ntheir example. And the guilt of all would thus become the security of\\r\\nall. Our past experience has exhibited the operation of this spirit in\\r\\nits full light. There would, in fact, be an insuperable difficulty in\\r\\nascertaining when force could with propriety be employed. In the article\\r\\nof pecuniary contribution, which would be the most usual source of\\r\\ndelinquency, it would often be impossible to decide whether it had\\r\\nproceeded from disinclination or inability. The pretense of the latter\\r\\nwould always be at hand. And the case must be very flagrant in which its\\r\\nfallacy could be detected with sufficient certainty to justify the harsh\\r\\nexpedient of compulsion. It is easy to see that this problem alone, as\\r\\noften as it should occur, would open a wide field for the exercise of\\r\\nfactious views, of partiality, and of oppression, in the majority that\\r\\nhappened to prevail in the national council.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seems to require no pains to prove that the States ought not to\\r\\nprefer a national Constitution which could only be kept in motion by\\r\\nthe instrumentality of a large army continually on foot to execute the\\r\\nordinary requisitions or decrees of the government. And yet this is the\\r\\nplain alternative involved by those who wish to deny it the power of\\r\\nextending its operations to individuals. Such a scheme, if practicable\\r\\nat all, would instantly degenerate into a military despotism; but it\\r\\nwill be found in every light impracticable. The resources of the Union\\r\\nwould not be equal to the maintenance of an army considerable enough to\\r\\nconfine the larger States within the limits of their duty; nor would the\\r\\nmeans ever be furnished of forming such an army in the first instance.\\r\\nWhoever considers the populousness and strength of several of these\\r\\nStates singly at the present juncture, and looks forward to what they\\r\\nwill become, even at the distance of half a century, will at once\\r\\ndismiss as idle and visionary any scheme which aims at regulating their\\r\\nmovements by laws to operate upon them in their collective capacities,\\r\\nand to be executed by a coercion applicable to them in the same\\r\\ncapacities. A project of this kind is little less romantic than the\\r\\nmonster-taming spirit which is attributed to the fabulous heroes and\\r\\ndemi-gods of antiquity.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven in those confederacies which have been composed of members smaller\\r\\nthan many of our counties, the principle of legislation for sovereign\\r\\nStates, supported by military coercion, has never been found effectual.\\r\\nIt has rarely been attempted to be employed, but against the weaker\\r\\nmembers; and in most instances attempts to coerce the refractory and\\r\\ndisobedient have been the signals of bloody wars, in which one half of\\r\\nthe confederacy has displayed its banners against the other half.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe result of these observations to an intelligent mind must be\\r\\nclearly this, that if it be possible at any rate to construct a federal\\r\\ngovernment capable of regulating the common concerns and preserving the\\r\\ngeneral tranquillity, it must be founded, as to the objects committed\\r\\nto its care, upon the reverse of the principle contended for by the\\r\\nopponents of the proposed Constitution. It must carry its agency to\\r\\nthe persons of the citizens. It must stand in need of no intermediate\\r\\nlegislations; but must itself be empowered to employ the arm of the\\r\\nordinary magistrate to execute its own resolutions. The majesty of the\\r\\nnational authority must be manifested through the medium of the courts\\r\\nof justice. The government of the Union, like that of each State,\\r\\nmust be able to address itself immediately to the hopes and fears of\\r\\nindividuals; and to attract to its support those passions which have the\\r\\nstrongest influence upon the human heart. It must, in short, possess all\\r\\nthe means, and have aright to resort to all the methods, of executing\\r\\nthe powers with which it is intrusted, that are possessed and exercised\\r\\nby the government of the particular States.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this reasoning it may perhaps be objected, that if any State should\\r\\nbe disaffected to the authority of the Union, it could at any time\\r\\nobstruct the execution of its laws, and bring the matter to the same\\r\\nissue of force, with the necessity of which the opposite scheme is\\r\\nreproached.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plausibility of this objection will vanish the moment we advert to\\r\\nthe essential difference between a mere NON-COMPLIANCE and a DIRECT and\\r\\nACTIVE RESISTANCE. If the interposition of the State legislatures be\\r\\nnecessary to give effect to a measure of the Union, they have only NOT\\r\\nTO ACT, or TO ACT EVASIVELY, and the measure is defeated. This neglect\\r\\nof duty may be disguised under affected but unsubstantial provisions,\\r\\nso as not to appear, and of course not to excite any alarm in the people\\r\\nfor the safety of the Constitution. The State leaders may even make\\r\\na merit of their surreptitious invasions of it on the ground of some\\r\\ntemporary convenience, exemption, or advantage.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if the execution of the laws of the national government should not\\r\\nrequire the intervention of the State legislatures, if they were to pass\\r\\ninto immediate operation upon the citizens themselves, the particular\\r\\ngovernments could not interrupt their progress without an open and\\r\\nviolent exertion of an unconstitutional power. No omissions nor evasions\\r\\nwould answer the end. They would be obliged to act, and in such a manner\\r\\nas would leave no doubt that they had encroached on the national rights.\\r\\nAn experiment of this nature would always be hazardous in the face of a\\r\\nconstitution in any degree competent to its own defense, and of a\\r\\npeople enlightened enough to distinguish between a legal exercise and\\r\\nan illegal usurpation of authority. The success of it would require not\\r\\nmerely a factious majority in the legislature, but the concurrence of\\r\\nthe courts of justice and of the body of the people. If the judges were\\r\\nnot embarked in a conspiracy with the legislature, they would pronounce\\r\\nthe resolutions of such a majority to be contrary to the supreme law\\r\\nof the land, unconstitutional, and void. If the people were not tainted\\r\\nwith the spirit of their State representatives, they, as the natural\\r\\nguardians of the Constitution, would throw their weight into the\\r\\nnational scale and give it a decided preponderancy in the contest.\\r\\nAttempts of this kind would not often be made with levity or rashness,\\r\\nbecause they could seldom be made without danger to the authors, unless\\r\\nin cases of a tyrannical exercise of the federal authority.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf opposition to the national government should arise from the\\r\\ndisorderly conduct of refractory or seditious individuals, it could be\\r\\novercome by the same means which are daily employed against the same\\r\\nevil under the State governments. The magistracy, being equally the\\r\\nministers of the law of the land, from whatever source it might\\r\\nemanate, would doubtless be as ready to guard the national as the local\\r\\nregulations from the inroads of private licentiousness. As to those\\r\\npartial commotions and insurrections, which sometimes disquiet society,\\r\\nfrom the intrigues of an inconsiderable faction, or from sudden or\\r\\noccasional illhumors that do not infect the great body of the community\\r\\nthe general government could command more extensive resources for the\\r\\nsuppression of disturbances of that kind than would be in the power\\r\\nof any single member. And as to those mortal feuds which, in certain\\r\\nconjunctures, spread a conflagration through a whole nation, or through\\r\\na very large proportion of it, proceeding either from weighty causes of\\r\\ndiscontent given by the government or from the contagion of some\\r\\nviolent popular paroxysm, they do not fall within any ordinary rules of\\r\\ncalculation. When they happen, they commonly amount to revolutions and\\r\\ndismemberments of empire. No form of government can always either avoid\\r\\nor control them. It is in vain to hope to guard against events too\\r\\nmighty for human foresight or precaution, and it would be idle to object\\r\\nto a government because it could not perform impossibilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nPUBLIUS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\", \"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Same Subject Continued (The Insufficiency of the Present\\r\\nConfederation to Preserve the Union)\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the Independent Journal. Wednesday, December 5, 1787\\r\\n\\r\\nHAMILTON\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\r\\n\\r\\nAN OBJECTION, of a nature different from that which has been stated and\\r\\nanswered, in my last address, may perhaps be likewise urged against the\\r\\nprinciple of legislation for the individual citizens of America. It may\\r\\nbe said that it would tend to render the government of the Union too\\r\\npowerful, and to enable it to absorb those residuary authorities, which\\r\\nit might be judged proper to leave with the States for local purposes.\\r\\nAllowing the utmost latitude to the love of power which any reasonable\\r\\nman can require, I confess I am at a loss to discover what temptation\\r\\nthe persons intrusted with the administration of the general government\\r\\ncould ever feel to divest the States of the authorities of that\\r\\ndescription. The regulation of the mere domestic police of a State\\r\\nappears to me to hold out slender allurements to ambition. Commerce,\\r\\nfinance, negotiation, and war seem to comprehend all the objects which\\r\\nhave charms for minds governed by that passion; and all the powers\\r\\nnecessary to those objects ought, in the first instance, to be lodged in\\r\\nthe national depository. The administration of private justice between\\r\\nthe citizens of the same State, the supervision of agriculture and of\\r\\nother concerns of a similar nature, all those things, in short, which\\r\\nare proper to be provided for by local legislation, can never be\\r\\ndesirable cares of a general jurisdiction. It is therefore improbable\\r\\nthat there should exist a disposition in the federal councils to\\r\\nusurp the powers with which they are connected; because the attempt to\\r\\nexercise those powers would be as troublesome as it would be nugatory;\\r\\nand the possession of them, for that reason, would contribute nothing\\r\\nto the dignity, to the importance, or to the splendor of the national\\r\\ngovernment.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut let it be admitted, for argument's sake, that mere wantonness and\\r\\nlust of domination would be sufficient to beget that disposition; still\\r\\nit may be safely affirmed, that the sense of the constituent body of the\\r\\nnational representatives, or, in other words, the people of the several\\r\\nStates, would control the indulgence of so extravagant an appetite. It\\r\\nwill always be far more easy for the State governments to encroach upon\\r\\nthe national authorities than for the national government to encroach\\r\\nupon the State authorities. The proof of this proposition turns upon\\r\\nthe greater degree of influence which the State governments if they\\r\\nadminister their affairs with uprightness and prudence, will generally\\r\\npossess over the people; a circumstance which at the same time teaches\\r\\nus that there is an inherent and intrinsic weakness in all federal\\r\\nconstitutions; and that too much pains cannot be taken in their\\r\\norganization, to give them all the force which is compatible with the\\r\\nprinciples of liberty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe superiority of influence in favor of the particular governments\\r\\nwould result partly from the diffusive construction of the national\\r\\ngovernment, but chiefly from the nature of the objects to which the\\r\\nattention of the State administrations would be directed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a known fact in human nature, that its affections are commonly\\r\\nweak in proportion to the distance or diffusiveness of the object. Upon\\r\\nthe same principle that a man is more attached to his family than to his\\r\\nneighborhood, to his neighborhood than to the community at large, the\\r\\npeople of each State would be apt to feel a stronger bias towards their\\r\\nlocal governments than towards the government of the Union; unless\\r\\nthe force of that principle should be destroyed by a much better\\r\\nadministration of the latter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis strong propensity of the human heart would find powerful\\r\\nauxiliaries in the objects of State regulation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe variety of more minute interests, which will necessarily fall under\\r\\nthe superintendence of the local administrations, and which will form so\\r\\nmany rivulets of influence, running through every part of the society,\\r\\ncannot be particularized, without involving a detail too tedious and\\r\\nuninteresting to compensate for the instruction it might afford.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is one transcendant advantage belonging to the province of the\\r\\nState governments, which alone suffices to place the matter in a clear\\r\\nand satisfactory light,--I mean the ordinary administration of criminal\\r\\nand civil justice. This, of all others, is the most powerful, most\\r\\nuniversal, and most attractive source of popular obedience and\\r\\nattachment. It is that which, being the immediate and visible guardian\\r\\nof life and property, having its benefits and its terrors in constant\\r\\nactivity before the public eye, regulating all those personal interests\\r\\nand familiar concerns to which the sensibility of individuals is more\\r\\nimmediately awake, contributes, more than any other circumstance,\\r\\nto impressing upon the minds of the people, affection, esteem, and\\r\\nreverence towards the government. This great cement of society, which\\r\\nwill diffuse itself almost wholly through the channels of the particular\\r\\ngovernments, independent of all other causes of influence, would insure\\r\\nthem so decided an empire over their respective citizens as to render\\r\\nthem at all times a complete counterpoise, and, not unfrequently,\\r\\ndangerous rivals to the power of the Union.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe operations of the national government, on the other hand, falling\\r\\nless immediately under the observation of the mass of the citizens, the\\r\\nbenefits derived from it will chiefly be perceived and attended to by\\r\\nspeculative men. Relating to more general interests, they will be less\\r\\napt to come home to the feelings of the people; and, in proportion,\\r\\nless likely to inspire an habitual sense of obligation, and an active\\r\\nsentiment of attachment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reasoning on this head has been abundantly exemplified by the\\r\\nexperience of all federal constitutions with which we are acquainted,\\r\\nand of all others which have borne the least analogy to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the ancient feudal systems were not, strictly speaking,\\r\\nconfederacies, yet they partook of the nature of that species of\\r\\nassociation. There was a common head, chieftain, or sovereign, whose\\r\\nauthority extended over the whole nation; and a number of subordinate\\r\\nvassals, or feudatories, who had large portions of land allotted to\\r\\nthem, and numerous trains of INFERIOR vassals or retainers, who occupied\\r\\nand cultivated that land upon the tenure of fealty or obedience, to\\r\\nthe persons of whom they held it. Each principal vassal was a kind of\\r\\nsovereign, within his particular demesnes. The consequences of this\\r\\nsituation were a continual opposition to authority of the sovereign, and\\r\\nfrequent wars between the great barons or chief feudatories themselves.\\r\\nThe power of the head of the nation was commonly too weak, either\\r\\nto preserve the public peace, or to protect the people against the\\r\\noppressions of their immediate lords. This period of European affairs is\\r\\nemphatically styled by historians, the times of feudal anarchy.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the sovereign happened to be a man of vigorous and warlike temper\\r\\nand of superior abilities, he would acquire a personal weight and\\r\\ninfluence, which answered, for the time, the purpose of a more regular\\r\\nauthority. But in general, the power of the barons triumphed over that\\r\\nof the prince; and in many instances his dominion was entirely thrown\\r\\noff, and the great fiefs were erected into independent principalities or\\r\\nStates. In those instances in which the monarch finally prevailed over\\r\\nhis vassals, his success was chiefly owing to the tyranny of those\\r\\nvassals over their dependents. The barons, or nobles, equally the\\r\\nenemies of the sovereign and the oppressors of the common people, were\\r\\ndreaded and detested by both; till mutual danger and mutual interest\\r\\neffected a union between them fatal to the power of the aristocracy. Had\\r\\nthe nobles, by a conduct of clemency and justice, preserved the fidelity\\r\\nand devotion of their retainers and followers, the contests between them\\r\\nand the prince must almost always have ended in their favor, and in the\\r\\nabridgment or subversion of the royal authority.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not an assertion founded merely in speculation or conjecture.\\r\\nAmong other illustrations of its truth which might be cited, Scotland\\r\\nwill furnish a cogent example. The spirit of clanship which was, at an\\r\\nearly day, introduced into that kingdom, uniting the nobles and\\r\\ntheir dependants by ties equivalent to those of kindred, rendered the\\r\\naristocracy a constant overmatch for the power of the monarch, till the\\r\\nincorporation with England subdued its fierce and ungovernable spirit,\\r\\nand reduced it within those rules of subordination which a more rational\\r\\nand more energetic system of civil polity had previously established in\\r\\nthe latter kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe separate governments in a confederacy may aptly be compared with\\r\\nthe feudal baronies; with this advantage in their favor, that from the\\r\\nreasons already explained, they will generally possess the confidence\\r\\nand good-will of the people, and with so important a support, will be\\r\\nable effectually to oppose all encroachments of the national government.\\r\\nIt will be well if they are not able to counteract its legitimate and\\r\\nnecessary authority. The points of similitude consist in the rivalship\\r\\nof power, applicable to both, and in the CONCENTRATION of large portions\\r\\nof the strength of the community into particular DEPOSITORIES, in one\\r\\ncase at the disposal of individuals, in the other case at the disposal\\r\\nof political bodies.\\r\\n\\r\\nA concise review of the events that have attended confederate\\r\\ngovernments will further illustrate this important doctrine; an\\r\\ninattention to which has been the great source of our political\\r\\nmistakes, and has given our jealousy a direction to the wrong side. This\\r\\nreview shall form the subject of some ensuing papers.\\r\\n\\r\\nPUBLIUS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\", \"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Same Subject Continued (The Insufficiency of the Present\\r\\nConfederation to Preserve the Union) For the New York Packet. Friday,\\r\\nDecember 7, 1787\\r\\n\\r\\nMADISON, with HAMILTON\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\r\\n\\r\\nAMONG the confederacies of antiquity, the most considerable was that of\\r\\nthe Grecian republics, associated under the Amphictyonic council. From\\r\\nthe best accounts transmitted of this celebrated institution, it bore\\r\\na very instructive analogy to the present Confederation of the American\\r\\nStates.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe members retained the character of independent and sovereign states,\\r\\nand had equal votes in the federal council. This council had a general\\r\\nauthority to propose and resolve whatever it judged necessary for the\\r\\ncommon welfare of Greece; to declare and carry on war; to decide, in\\r\\nthe last resort, all controversies between the members; to fine the\\r\\naggressing party; to employ the whole force of the confederacy against\\r\\nthe disobedient; to admit new members. The Amphictyons were the\\r\\nguardians of religion, and of the immense riches belonging to the temple\\r\\nof Delphos, where they had the right of jurisdiction in controversies\\r\\nbetween the inhabitants and those who came to consult the oracle. As a\\r\\nfurther provision for the efficacy of the federal powers, they took an\\r\\noath mutually to defend and protect the united cities, to punish\\r\\nthe violators of this oath, and to inflict vengeance on sacrilegious\\r\\ndespoilers of the temple.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn theory, and upon paper, this apparatus of powers seems amply\\r\\nsufficient for all general purposes. In several material instances,\\r\\nthey exceed the powers enumerated in the articles of confederation. The\\r\\nAmphictyons had in their hands the superstition of the times, one of the\\r\\nprincipal engines by which government was then maintained; they had a\\r\\ndeclared authority to use coercion against refractory cities, and were\\r\\nbound by oath to exert this authority on the necessary occasions.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery different, nevertheless, was the experiment from the theory.\\r\\nThe powers, like those of the present Congress, were administered by\\r\\ndeputies appointed wholly by the cities in their political capacities;\\r\\nand exercised over them in the same capacities. Hence the weakness,\\r\\nthe disorders, and finally the destruction of the confederacy. The\\r\\nmore powerful members, instead of being kept in awe and subordination,\\r\\ntyrannized successively over all the rest. Athens, as we learn from\\r\\nDemosthenes, was the arbiter of Greece seventy-three years. The\\r\\nLacedaemonians next governed it twenty-nine years; at a subsequent\\r\\nperiod, after the battle of Leuctra, the Thebans had their turn of\\r\\ndomination.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt happened but too often, according to Plutarch, that the deputies of\\r\\nthe strongest cities awed and corrupted those of the weaker; and that\\r\\njudgment went in favor of the most powerful party.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven in the midst of defensive and dangerous wars with Persia and\\r\\nMacedon, the members never acted in concert, and were, more or fewer\\r\\nof them, eternally the dupes or the hirelings of the common enemy.\\r\\nThe intervals of foreign war were filled up by domestic vicissitudes\\r\\nconvulsions, and carnage.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the conclusion of the war with Xerxes, it appears that the\\r\\nLacedaemonians required that a number of the cities should be turned\\r\\nout of the confederacy for the unfaithful part they had acted. The\\r\\nAthenians, finding that the Lacedaemonians would lose fewer partisans by\\r\\nsuch a measure than themselves, and would become masters of the public\\r\\ndeliberations, vigorously opposed and defeated the attempt. This piece\\r\\nof history proves at once the inefficiency of the union, the ambition\\r\\nand jealousy of its most powerful members, and the dependent and\\r\\ndegraded condition of the rest. The smaller members, though entitled by\\r\\nthe theory of their system to revolve in equal pride and majesty around\\r\\nthe common center, had become, in fact, satellites of the orbs of\\r\\nprimary magnitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad the Greeks, says the Abbe Milot, been as wise as they were\\r\\ncourageous, they would have been admonished by experience of the\\r\\nnecessity of a closer union, and would have availed themselves of\\r\\nthe peace which followed their success against the Persian arms, to\\r\\nestablish such a reformation. Instead of this obvious policy, Athens\\r\\nand Sparta, inflated with the victories and the glory they had acquired,\\r\\nbecame first rivals and then enemies; and did each other infinitely more\\r\\nmischief than they had suffered from Xerxes. Their mutual jealousies,\\r\\nfears, hatreds, and injuries ended in the celebrated Peloponnesian war;\\r\\nwhich itself ended in the ruin and slavery of the Athenians who had\\r\\nbegun it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a weak government, when not at war, is ever agitated by internal\\r\\ndissentions, so these never fail to bring on fresh calamities from\\r\\nabroad. The Phocians having ploughed up some consecrated ground\\r\\nbelonging to the temple of Apollo, the Amphictyonic council, according\\r\\nto the superstition of the age, imposed a fine on the sacrilegious\\r\\noffenders. The Phocians, being abetted by Athens and Sparta, refused to\\r\\nsubmit to the decree. The Thebans, with others of the cities, undertook\\r\\nto maintain the authority of the Amphictyons, and to avenge the violated\\r\\ngod. The latter, being the weaker party, invited the assistance of\\r\\nPhilip of Macedon, who had secretly fostered the contest. Philip gladly\\r\\nseized the opportunity of executing the designs he had long planned\\r\\nagainst the liberties of Greece. By his intrigues and bribes he won\\r\\nover to his interests the popular leaders of several cities; by their\\r\\ninfluence and votes, gained admission into the Amphictyonic council; and\\r\\nby his arts and his arms, made himself master of the confederacy.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch were the consequences of the fallacious principle on which this\\r\\ninteresting establishment was founded. Had Greece, says a judicious\\r\\nobserver on her fate, been united by a stricter confederation, and\\r\\npersevered in her union, she would never have worn the chains of\\r\\nMacedon; and might have proved a barrier to the vast projects of Rome.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Achaean league, as it is called, was another society of Grecian\\r\\nrepublics, which supplies us with valuable instruction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union here was far more intimate, and its organization much wiser,\\r\\nthan in the preceding instance. It will accordingly appear, that though\\r\\nnot exempt from a similar catastrophe, it by no means equally deserved\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cities composing this league retained their municipal jurisdiction,\\r\\nappointed their own officers, and enjoyed a perfect equality. The\\r\\nsenate, in which they were represented, had the sole and exclusive right\\r\\nof peace and war; of sending and receiving ambassadors; of entering into\\r\\ntreaties and alliances; of appointing a chief magistrate or praetor, as\\r\\nhe was called, who commanded their armies, and who, with the advice and\\r\\nconsent of ten of the senators, not only administered the government in\\r\\nthe recess of the senate, but had a great share in its deliberations,\\r\\nwhen assembled. According to the primitive constitution, there were two\\r\\npraetors associated in the administration; but on trial a single one was\\r\\npreferred.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt appears that the cities had all the same laws and customs, the\\r\\nsame weights and measures, and the same money. But how far this\\r\\neffect proceeded from the authority of the federal council is left in\\r\\nuncertainty. It is said only that the cities were in a manner compelled\\r\\nto receive the same laws and usages. When Lacedaemon was brought into\\r\\nthe league by Philopoemen, it was attended with an abolition of the\\r\\ninstitutions and laws of Lycurgus, and an adoption of those of the\\r\\nAchaeans. The Amphictyonic confederacy, of which she had been a member,\\r\\nleft her in the full exercise of her government and her legislation.\\r\\nThis circumstance alone proves a very material difference in the genius\\r\\nof the two systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is much to be regretted that such imperfect monuments remain of\\r\\nthis curious political fabric. Could its interior structure and regular\\r\\noperation be ascertained, it is probable that more light would be thrown\\r\\nby it on the science of federal government, than by any of the like\\r\\nexperiments with which we are acquainted.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne important fact seems to be witnessed by all the historians who take\\r\\nnotice of Achaean affairs. It is, that as well after the renovation of\\r\\nthe league by Aratus, as before its dissolution by the arts of\\r\\nMacedon, there was infinitely more of moderation and justice in the\\r\\nadministration of its government, and less of violence and sedition in\\r\\nthe people, than were to be found in any of the cities exercising SINGLY\\r\\nall the prerogatives of sovereignty. The Abbe Mably, in his observations\\r\\non Greece, says that the popular government, which was so tempestuous\\r\\nelsewhere, caused no disorders in the members of the Achaean republic,\\r\\nBECAUSE IT WAS THERE TEMPERED BY THE GENERAL AUTHORITY AND LAWS OF THE\\r\\nCONFEDERACY.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are not to conclude too hastily, however, that faction did not, in\\r\\na certain degree, agitate the particular cities; much less that a due\\r\\nsubordination and harmony reigned in the general system. The contrary is\\r\\nsufficiently displayed in the vicissitudes and fate of the republic.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst the Amphictyonic confederacy remained, that of the Achaeans,\\r\\nwhich comprehended the less important cities only, made little figure on\\r\\nthe theatre of Greece. When the former became a victim to Macedon,\\r\\nthe latter was spared by the policy of Philip and Alexander. Under the\\r\\nsuccessors of these princes, however, a different policy prevailed.\\r\\nThe arts of division were practiced among the Achaeans. Each city was\\r\\nseduced into a separate interest; the union was dissolved. Some of the\\r\\ncities fell under the tyranny of Macedonian garrisons; others under that\\r\\nof usurpers springing out of their own confusions. Shame and oppression\\r\\nerelong awaken their love of liberty. A few cities reunited. Their\\r\\nexample was followed by others, as opportunities were found of\\r\\ncutting off their tyrants. The league soon embraced almost the whole\\r\\nPeloponnesus. Macedon saw its progress; but was hindered by internal\\r\\ndissensions from stopping it. All Greece caught the enthusiasm and\\r\\nseemed ready to unite in one confederacy, when the jealousy and envy in\\r\\nSparta and Athens, of the rising glory of the Achaeans, threw a fatal\\r\\ndamp on the enterprise. The dread of the Macedonian power induced the\\r\\nleague to court the alliance of the Kings of Egypt and Syria, who, as\\r\\nsuccessors of Alexander, were rivals of the king of Macedon. This policy\\r\\nwas defeated by Cleomenes, king of Sparta, who was led by his ambition\\r\\nto make an unprovoked attack on his neighbors, the Achaeans, and who,\\r\\nas an enemy to Macedon, had interest enough with the Egyptian and Syrian\\r\\nprinces to effect a breach of their engagements with the league.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Achaeans were now reduced to the dilemma of submitting to Cleomenes,\\r\\nor of supplicating the aid of Macedon, its former oppressor. The latter\\r\\nexpedient was adopted. The contests of the Greeks always afforded a\\r\\npleasing opportunity to that powerful neighbor of intermeddling in their\\r\\naffairs. A Macedonian army quickly appeared. Cleomenes was vanquished.\\r\\nThe Achaeans soon experienced, as often happens, that a victorious and\\r\\npowerful ally is but another name for a master. All that their most\\r\\nabject compliances could obtain from him was a toleration of the\\r\\nexercise of their laws. Philip, who was now on the throne of Macedon,\\r\\nsoon provoked by his tyrannies, fresh combinations among the Greeks. The\\r\\nAchaeans, though weakened by internal dissensions and by the revolt\\r\\nof Messene, one of its members, being joined by the AEtolians and\\r\\nAthenians, erected the standard of opposition. Finding themselves,\\r\\nthough thus supported, unequal to the undertaking, they once more had\\r\\nrecourse to the dangerous expedient of introducing the succor of foreign\\r\\narms. The Romans, to whom the invitation was made, eagerly embraced\\r\\nit. Philip was conquered; Macedon subdued. A new crisis ensued to\\r\\nthe league. Dissensions broke out among it members. These the Romans\\r\\nfostered. Callicrates and other popular leaders became mercenary\\r\\ninstruments for inveigling their countrymen. The more effectually to\\r\\nnourish discord and disorder the Romans had, to the astonishment of\\r\\nthose who confided in their sincerity, already proclaimed universal\\r\\nliberty(1) throughout Greece. With the same insidious views, they now\\r\\nseduced the members from the league, by representing to their pride the\\r\\nviolation it committed on their sovereignty. By these arts this union,\\r\\nthe last hope of Greece, the last hope of ancient liberty, was torn into\\r\\npieces; and such imbecility and distraction introduced, that the arms of\\r\\nRome found little difficulty in completing the ruin which their arts\\r\\nhad commenced. The Achaeans were cut to pieces, and Achaia loaded with\\r\\nchains, under which it is groaning at this hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have thought it not superfluous to give the outlines of this important\\r\\nportion of history; both because it teaches more than one lesson, and\\r\\nbecause, as a supplement to the outlines of the Achaean constitution,\\r\\nit emphatically illustrates the tendency of federal bodies rather to\\r\\nanarchy among the members, than to tyranny in the head.\\r\\n\\r\\nPUBLIUS\\r\\n\\r\\n1. This was but another name more specious for the independence of the\\r\\nmembers on the federal head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\", \"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Same Subject Continued (The Insufficiency of the Present\\r\\nConfederation to Preserve the Union)\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the Independent Journal. Saturday, December 8, 1787\\r\\n\\r\\nMADISON, with HAMILTON\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE examples of ancient confederacies, cited in my last paper, have not\\r\\nexhausted the source of experimental instruction on this subject. There\\r\\nare existing institutions, founded on a similar principle, which\\r\\nmerit particular consideration. The first which presents itself is the\\r\\nGermanic body.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early ages of Christianity, Germany was occupied by seven\\r\\ndistinct nations, who had no common chief. The Franks, one of the\\r\\nnumber, having conquered the Gauls, established the kingdom which has\\r\\ntaken its name from them. In the ninth century Charlemagne, its warlike\\r\\nmonarch, carried his victorious arms in every direction; and Germany\\r\\nbecame a part of his vast dominions. On the dismemberment, which\\r\\ntook place under his sons, this part was erected into a separate and\\r\\nindependent empire. Charlemagne and his immediate descendants possessed\\r\\nthe reality, as well as the ensigns and dignity of imperial power.\\r\\nBut the principal vassals, whose fiefs had become hereditary, and\\r\\nwho composed the national diets which Charlemagne had not abolished,\\r\\ngradually threw off the yoke and advanced to sovereign jurisdiction\\r\\nand independence. The force of imperial sovereignty was insufficient\\r\\nto restrain such powerful dependants; or to preserve the unity and\\r\\ntranquillity of the empire. The most furious private wars, accompanied\\r\\nwith every species of calamity, were carried on between the different\\r\\nprinces and states. The imperial authority, unable to maintain the\\r\\npublic order, declined by degrees till it was almost extinct in the\\r\\nanarchy, which agitated the long interval between the death of the last\\r\\nemperor of the Suabian, and the accession of the first emperor of\\r\\nthe Austrian lines. In the eleventh century the emperors enjoyed full\\r\\nsovereignty: In the fifteenth they had little more than the symbols and\\r\\ndecorations of power.\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of this feudal system, which has itself many of the important\\r\\nfeatures of a confederacy, has grown the federal system which\\r\\nconstitutes the Germanic empire. Its powers are vested in a diet\\r\\nrepresenting the component members of the confederacy; in the emperor,\\r\\nwho is the executive magistrate, with a negative on the decrees of the\\r\\ndiet; and in the imperial chamber and the aulic council, two judiciary\\r\\ntribunals having supreme jurisdiction in controversies which concern the\\r\\nempire, or which happen among its members.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe diet possesses the general power of legislating for the empire; of\\r\\nmaking war and peace; contracting alliances; assessing quotas of troops\\r\\nand money; constructing fortresses; regulating coin; admitting new\\r\\nmembers; and subjecting disobedient members to the ban of the empire,\\r\\nby which the party is degraded from his sovereign rights and his\\r\\npossessions forfeited. The members of the confederacy are expressly\\r\\nrestricted from entering into compacts prejudicial to the empire; from\\r\\nimposing tolls and duties on their mutual intercourse, without the\\r\\nconsent of the emperor and diet; from altering the value of money; from\\r\\ndoing injustice to one another; or from affording assistance or retreat\\r\\nto disturbers of the public peace. And the ban is denounced against such\\r\\nas shall violate any of these restrictions. The members of the diet, as\\r\\nsuch, are subject in all cases to be judged by the emperor and diet, and\\r\\nin their private capacities by the aulic council and imperial chamber.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prerogatives of the emperor are numerous. The most important of them\\r\\nare: his exclusive right to make propositions to the diet; to negative\\r\\nits resolutions; to name ambassadors; to confer dignities and titles; to\\r\\nfill vacant electorates; to found universities; to grant privileges not\\r\\ninjurious to the states of the empire; to receive and apply the public\\r\\nrevenues; and generally to watch over the public safety. In certain\\r\\ncases, the electors form a council to him. In quality of emperor, he\\r\\npossesses no territory within the empire, nor receives any revenue\\r\\nfor his support. But his revenue and dominions, in other qualities,\\r\\nconstitute him one of the most powerful princes in Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom such a parade of constitutional powers, in the representatives and\\r\\nhead of this confederacy, the natural supposition would be, that it must\\r\\nform an exception to the general character which belongs to its kindred\\r\\nsystems. Nothing would be further from the reality. The fundamental\\r\\nprinciple on which it rests, that the empire is a community of\\r\\nsovereigns, that the diet is a representation of sovereigns and that the\\r\\nlaws are addressed to sovereigns, renders the empire a nerveless body,\\r\\nincapable of regulating its own members, insecure against external\\r\\ndangers, and agitated with unceasing fermentations in its own bowels.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe history of Germany is a history of wars between the emperor and the\\r\\nprinces and states; of wars among the princes and states themselves;\\r\\nof the licentiousness of the strong, and the oppression of the weak; of\\r\\nforeign intrusions, and foreign intrigues; of requisitions of men and\\r\\nmoney disregarded, or partially complied with; of attempts to enforce\\r\\nthem, altogether abortive, or attended with slaughter and desolation,\\r\\ninvolving the innocent with the guilty; of general imbecility,\\r\\nconfusion, and misery.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the sixteenth century, the emperor, with one part of the empire on\\r\\nhis side, was seen engaged against the other princes and states. In one\\r\\nof the conflicts, the emperor himself was put to flight, and very near\\r\\nbeing made prisoner by the elector of Saxony. The late king of Prussia\\r\\nwas more than once pitted against his imperial sovereign; and commonly\\r\\nproved an overmatch for him. Controversies and wars among the members\\r\\nthemselves have been so common, that the German annals are crowded\\r\\nwith the bloody pages which describe them. Previous to the peace of\\r\\nWestphalia, Germany was desolated by a war of thirty years, in which the\\r\\nemperor, with one half of the empire, was on one side, and Sweden, with\\r\\nthe other half, on the opposite side. Peace was at length negotiated,\\r\\nand dictated by foreign powers; and the articles of it, to which\\r\\nforeign powers are parties, made a fundamental part of the Germanic\\r\\nconstitution.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the nation happens, on any emergency, to be more united by the\\r\\nnecessity of self-defense, its situation is still deplorable. Military\\r\\npreparations must be preceded by so many tedious discussions, arising\\r\\nfrom the jealousies, pride, separate views, and clashing pretensions of\\r\\nsovereign bodies, that before the diet can settle the arrangements, the\\r\\nenemy are in the field; and before the federal troops are ready to take\\r\\nit, are retiring into winter quarters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe small body of national troops, which has been judged necessary in\\r\\ntime of peace, is defectively kept up, badly paid, infected with\\r\\nlocal prejudices, and supported by irregular and disproportionate\\r\\ncontributions to the treasury.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe impossibility of maintaining order and dispensing justice among\\r\\nthese sovereign subjects, produced the experiment of dividing the\\r\\nempire into nine or ten circles or districts; of giving them an interior\\r\\norganization, and of charging them with the military execution of the\\r\\nlaws against delinquent and contumacious members. This experiment\\r\\nhas only served to demonstrate more fully the radical vice of the\\r\\nconstitution. Each circle is the miniature picture of the deformities of\\r\\nthis political monster. They either fail to execute their commissions,\\r\\nor they do it with all the devastation and carnage of civil war.\\r\\nSometimes whole circles are defaulters; and then they increase the\\r\\nmischief which they were instituted to remedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may form some judgment of this scheme of military coercion from a\\r\\nsample given by Thuanus. In Donawerth, a free and imperial city of the\\r\\ncircle of Suabia, the Abbe de St. Croix enjoyed certain immunities\\r\\nwhich had been reserved to him. In the exercise of these, on some public\\r\\noccasions, outrages were committed on him by the people of the city. The\\r\\nconsequence was that the city was put under the ban of the empire, and\\r\\nthe Duke of Bavaria, though director of another circle, obtained an\\r\\nappointment to enforce it. He soon appeared before the city with a\\r\\ncorps of ten thousand troops, and finding it a fit occasion, as he had\\r\\nsecretly intended from the beginning, to revive an antiquated claim, on\\r\\nthe pretext that his ancestors had suffered the place to be dismembered\\r\\nfrom his territory,(1) he took possession of it in his own name,\\r\\ndisarmed, and punished the inhabitants, and reannexed the city to his\\r\\ndomains.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be asked, perhaps, what has so long kept this disjointed machine\\r\\nfrom falling entirely to pieces? The answer is obvious: The weakness of\\r\\nmost of the members, who are unwilling to expose themselves to the\\r\\nmercy of foreign powers; the weakness of most of the principal members,\\r\\ncompared with the formidable powers all around them; the vast weight\\r\\nand influence which the emperor derives from his separate and hereditary\\r\\ndominions; and the interest he feels in preserving a system with which\\r\\nhis family pride is connected, and which constitutes him the first\\r\\nprince in Europe;--these causes support a feeble and precarious Union;\\r\\nwhilst the repellant quality, incident to the nature of sovereignty,\\r\\nand which time continually strengthens, prevents any reform whatever,\\r\\nfounded on a proper consolidation. Nor is it to be imagined, if this\\r\\nobstacle could be surmounted, that the neighboring powers would suffer\\r\\na revolution to take place which would give to the empire the force\\r\\nand preeminence to which it is entitled. Foreign nations have long\\r\\nconsidered themselves as interested in the changes made by events in\\r\\nthis constitution; and have, on various occasions, betrayed their policy\\r\\nof perpetuating its anarchy and weakness.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf more direct examples were wanting, Poland, as a government over local\\r\\nsovereigns, might not improperly be taken notice of. Nor could any proof\\r\\nmore striking be given of the calamities flowing from such institutions.\\r\\nEqually unfit for self-government and self-defense, it has long been at\\r\\nthe mercy of its powerful neighbors; who have lately had the mercy to\\r\\ndisburden it of one third of its people and territories.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe connection among the Swiss cantons scarcely amounts to a\\r\\nconfederacy; though it is sometimes cited as an instance of the\\r\\nstability of such institutions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey have no common treasury; no common troops even in war; no common\\r\\ncoin; no common judicatory; nor any other common mark of sovereignty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are kept together by the peculiarity of their topographical\\r\\nposition; by their individual weakness and insignificancy; by the fear\\r\\nof powerful neighbors, to one of which they were formerly subject;\\r\\nby the few sources of contention among a people of such simple and\\r\\nhomogeneous manners; by their joint interest in their dependent\\r\\npossessions; by the mutual aid they stand in need of, for suppressing\\r\\ninsurrections and rebellions, an aid expressly stipulated and often\\r\\nrequired and afforded; and by the necessity of some regular and\\r\\npermanent provision for accommodating disputes among the cantons. The\\r\\nprovision is, that the parties at variance shall each choose four judges\\r\\nout of the neutral cantons, who, in case of disagreement, choose\\r\\nan umpire. This tribunal, under an oath of impartiality, pronounces\\r\\ndefinitive sentence, which all the cantons are bound to enforce. The\\r\\ncompetency of this regulation may be estimated by a clause in their\\r\\ntreaty of 1683, with Victor Amadeus of Savoy; in which he obliges\\r\\nhimself to interpose as mediator in disputes between the cantons, and to\\r\\nemploy force, if necessary, against the contumacious party.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far as the peculiarity of their case will admit of comparison with\\r\\nthat of the United States, it serves to confirm the principle intended\\r\\nto be established. Whatever efficacy the union may have had in ordinary\\r\\ncases, it appears that the moment a cause of difference sprang up,\\r\\ncapable of trying its strength, it failed. The controversies on the\\r\\nsubject of religion, which in three instances have kindled violent and\\r\\nbloody contests, may be said, in fact, to have severed the league. The\\r\\nProtestant and Catholic cantons have since had their separate diets,\\r\\nwhere all the most important concerns are adjusted, and which have left\\r\\nthe general diet little other business than to take care of the common\\r\\nbailages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat separation had another consequence, which merits attention. It\\r\\nproduced opposite alliances with foreign powers: of Berne, at the\\r\\nhead of the Protestant association, with the United Provinces; and of\\r\\nLuzerne, at the head of the Catholic association, with France.\\r\\n\\r\\nPUBLIUS\\r\\n\\r\\n1.

Tuesday, December 11, 1787.\\r\\n\\r\\nMADISON, with HAMILTON\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE United Netherlands are a confederacy of republics, or rather of\\r\\naristocracies of a very remarkable texture, yet confirming all the\\r\\nlessons derived from those which we have already reviewed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe union is composed of seven coequal and sovereign states, and each\\r\\nstate or province is a composition of equal and independent cities.\\r\\nIn all important cases, not only the provinces but the cities must be\\r\\nunanimous.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sovereignty of the Union is represented by the States-General,\\r\\nconsisting usually of about fifty deputies appointed by the provinces.\\r\\nThey hold their seats, some for life, some for six, three, and one\\r\\nyears; from two provinces they continue in appointment during pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe States-General have authority to enter into treaties and alliances;\\r\\nto make war and peace; to raise armies and equip fleets; to ascertain\\r\\nquotas and demand contributions. In all these cases, however, unanimity\\r\\nand the sanction of their constituents are requisite. They have\\r\\nauthority to appoint and receive ambassadors; to execute treaties and\\r\\nalliances already formed; to provide for the collection of duties\\r\\non imports and exports; to regulate the mint, with a saving to the\\r\\nprovincial rights; to govern as sovereigns the dependent territories.\\r\\nThe provinces are restrained, unless with the general consent, from\\r\\nentering into foreign treaties; from establishing imposts injurious to\\r\\nothers, or charging their neighbors with higher duties than their own\\r\\nsubjects.
