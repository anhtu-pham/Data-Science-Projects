comprehending in its consequences nothing less than theexistence of the union, the safety and welfare of the parts of which itis composed, the fate of an empire in many respects the most interestingin the world. it has been frequently remarked that it seems to have beenreserved to the people of this country, by their conduct and example,to decide the important question, whether societies of men are reallycapable or not of establishing good government from reflection andchoice, or whether they are forever destined to depend for theirpolitical constitutions on accident and force. if there be any truthin the remark, the crisis at which we are arrived may with propriety beregarded as the era in which that decision is to be made; and a wrongelection of the part we shall act may, in this view, deserve to beconsidered as the general misfortune of mankind.\", \"this idea will add the inducements of philanthropy to those ofpatriotism, to heighten the solicitude which all considerate and goodmen must feel for the event. happy will it be if our choice should bedirected by a judicious estimate of our true interests, unperplexed andunbiased by considerations not connected with the public good. but thisis a thing more ardently to be wished than seriously to be expected. theplan offered to our deliberations affects too many particular interests,innovates upon too many local institutions, not to involve in itsdiscussion a variety of objects foreign to its merits, and of views,passions and prejudices little favorable to the discovery of truth.\", \"among the most formidable of the obstacles which the new constitutionwill have to encounter may readily be distinguished the obvious interestof a certain class of men in every state to resist all changes whichmay hazard a diminution of the power, emolument, and consequence ofthe offices they hold under the state establishments; and the pervertedambition of another class of men, who will either hope to aggrandizethemselves by the confusions of their country, or will flatterthemselves with fairer prospects of elevation from the subdivision ofthe empire into several partial confederacies than from its union underone government.\", \"it is not, however, my design to dwell upon observations of thisnature. i am well aware that it would be disingenuous to resolveindiscriminately the opposition of any set of men (merely because theirsituations might subject them to suspicion) into interested or ambitiousviews. candor will oblige us to admit that even such men may be actuatedby upright intentions; and it cannot be doubted that much of theopposition which has made its appearance, or may hereafter make itsappearance, will spring from sources, blameless at least, if notrespectable--the honest errors of minds led astray by preconceivedjealousies and fears. so numerous indeed and so powerful are the causeswhich serve to give a false bias to the judgment, that we, upon manyoccasions, see wise and good men on the wrong as well as on the rightside of questions of the first magnitude to society. this circumstance,if duly attended to, would furnish a lesson of moderation to thosewho are ever so much persuaded of their being in the right in anycontroversy. and a further reason for caution, in this respect, mightbe drawn from the reflection that we are not always sure that thosewho advocate the truth are influenced by purer principles than theirantagonists. ambition, avarice, personal animosity, party opposition,and many other motives not more laudable than these, are apt to operateas well upon those who support as those who oppose the right side of aquestion. were there not even these inducements to moderation, nothingcould be more ill-judged than that intolerant spirit which has, at alltimes, characterized political parties. for in politics, as in religion,it is equally absurd to aim at making proselytes by fire and sword.heresies in either can rarely be cured by persecution.\", \"and yet, however just these sentiments will be allowed to be, we havealready sufficient indications that it will happen in this as in allformer cases of great national discussion. a torrent of angry andmalignant passions will be let loose. to judge from the conduct of theopposite parties, we shall be led to conclude that they will mutuallyhope to evince the justness of their opinions, and to increase thenumber of their converts by the loudness of their declamations and thebitterness of their invectives. an enlightened zeal for the energyand efficiency of government will be stigmatized as the offspring of atemper fond of despotic power and hostile to the principles of liberty.an over-scrupulous jealousy of danger to the rights of the people,which is more commonly the fault of the head than of the heart, will berepresented as mere pretense and artifice, the stale bait for popularityat the expense of the public good. it will be forgotten, on the onehand, that jealousy is the usual concomitant of love, and that the nobleenthusiasm of liberty is apt to be infected with a spirit of narrow andilliberal distrust. on the other hand, it will be equally forgotten thatthe vigor of government is essential to the security of liberty; that,in the contemplation of a sound and well-informed judgment, theirinterest can never be separated; and that a dangerous ambition moreoften lurks behind the specious mask of zeal for the rights of thepeople than under the forbidden appearance of zeal for the firmness andefficiency of government. history will teach us that the former has beenfound a much more certain road to the introduction of despotism thanthe latter, and that of those men who have overturned the libertiesof republics, the greatest number have begun their career by payingan obsequious court to the people; commencing demagogues, and endingtyrants.\", \"in the course of the preceding observations, i have had an eye, myfellow-citizens, to putting you upon your guard against all attempts,from whatever quarter, to influence your decision in a matter of theutmost moment to your welfare, by any impressions other than those whichmay result from the evidence of truth. you will, no doubt, at the sametime, have collected from the general scope of them, that theyproceed from a source not unfriendly to the new constitution. yes,my countrymen, i own to you that, after having given it an attentiveconsideration, i am clearly of opinion it is your interest to adopt it.i am convinced that this is the safest course for your liberty, yourdignity, and your happiness. i affect not reserves which i do not feel.i will not amuse you with an appearance of deliberation when i havedecided. i frankly acknowledge to you my convictions, and i will freelylay before you the reasons on which they are founded. the consciousnessof good intentions disdains ambiguity. i shall not, however, multiplyprofessions on this head. my motives must remain in the depository ofmy own breast. my arguments will be open to all, and may be judged of byall. they shall at least be offered in a spirit which will not disgracethe cause of truth.\", \"i propose, in a series of papers, to discuss the following interestingparticulars:\", \"the utility of the union to your political prosperity the insufficiencyof the present confederation to preserve that union the necessity ofa government at least equally energetic with the one proposed, to theattainment of this object the conformity of the proposed constitutionto the true principles of republican government its analogy to yourown state constitution and lastly, the additional security which itsadoption will afford to the preservation of that species of government,to liberty, and to property.\", \"in the progress of this discussion i shall endeavor to give asatisfactory answer to all the objections which shall have made theirappearance, that may seem to have any claim to your attention.\", \"it may perhaps be thought superfluous to offer arguments to prove theutility of the union, a point, no doubt, deeply engraved on the heartsof the great body of the people in every state, and one, which it may beimagined, has no adversaries. but the fact is, that we already hearit whispered in the private circles of those who oppose the newconstitution, that the thirteen states are of too great extent forany general system, and that we must of necessity resort to separateconfederacies of distinct portions of the whole. this doctrine will,in all probability, be gradually propagated, till it has votaries enoughto countenance an open avowal of it. for nothing can be more evident,to those who are able to take an enlarged view of the subject, than thealternative of an adoption of the new constitution or a dismembermentof the union. it will therefore be of use to begin by examining theadvantages of that union, the certain evils, and the probable dangers,to which every state will be exposed from its dissolution. this shallaccordingly constitute the subject of my next address.\", \"publius\"]\n",

and certain characters who were much opposed to itformerly, are at present of the number. whatever may be the argumentsor inducements which have wrought this change in the sentiments anddeclarations of these gentlemen, it certainly would not be wise in thepeople at large to adopt these new political tenets without being fullyconvinced that they are founded in truth and sound policy.\", \"it has often given me pleasure to observe that independent americawas not composed of detached and distant territories, but that oneconnected, fertile, wide-spreading country was the portion of our westernsons of liberty. providence has in a particular manner blessed it witha variety of soils and productions, and watered it with innumerablestreams, for the delight and accommodation of its inhabitants. asuccession of navigable waters forms a kind of chain round its borders,as if to bind it together; while the most noble rivers in the world,running at convenient distances, present them with highways for theeasy communication of friendly aids, and the mutual transportation andexchange of their various commodities.\", \"with equal pleasure i have as often taken notice that providence hasbeen pleased to give this one connected country to one united people--apeople descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language,professing the same religion, attached to the same principles ofgovernment, very similar in their manners and customs, and who, by theirjoint counsels, arms, and efforts, fighting side by side throughouta long and bloody war, have nobly established general liberty andindependence.\", \"this country and this people seem to have been made for each other, andit appears as if it was the design of providence, that an inheritanceso proper and convenient for a band of brethren, united to each otherby the strongest ties, should never be split into a number of unsocial,jealous, and alien sovereignties.\", \"similar sentiments have hitherto prevailed among all orders anddenominations of men among us. to all general purposes we have uniformlybeen one people each individual citizen everywhere enjoying the samenational rights, privileges, and protection. as a nation we have madepeace and war; as a nation we have vanquished our common enemies; asa nation we have formed alliances, and made treaties, and entered intovarious compacts and conventions with foreign states.\", \"a strong sense of the value and blessings of union induced the people,at a very early period, to institute a federal government to preserveand perpetuate it. they formed it almost as soon as they had a politicalexistence; nay, at a time when their habitations were in flames, whenmany of their citizens were bleeding, and when the progress of hostilityand desolation left little room for those calm and mature inquiriesand reflections which must ever precede the formation of a wise andwell-balanced government for a free people. it is not to be wonderedat, that a government instituted in times so inauspicious, should onexperiment be found greatly deficient and inadequate to the purpose itwas intended to answer.\", \"this intelligent people perceived and regretted these defects. stillcontinuing no less attached to union than enamored of liberty, theyobserved the danger which immediately threatened the former and moreremotely the latter; and being persuaded that ample security for bothcould only be found in a national government more wisely framed, theyas with one voice, convened the late convention at philadelphia, to takethat important subject under consideration.\", \"this convention composed of men who possessed the confidence of thepeople, and many of whom had become highly distinguished by theirpatriotism, virtue and wisdom, in times which tried the minds and heartsof men, undertook the arduous task. in the mild season of peace, withminds unoccupied by other subjects, they passed many months in cool,uninterrupted, and daily consultation; and finally, without havingbeen awed by power, or influenced by any passions except love for theircountry, they presented and recommended to the people the plan producedby their joint and very unanimous councils.\", \"admit, for so is the fact, that this plan is only recommended, notimposed, yet let it be remembered that it is neither recommended toblind approbation, nor to blind reprobation; but to that sedate andcandid consideration which the magnitude and importance of the subjectdemand, and which it certainly ought to receive. but this (as wasremarked in the foregoing number of this paper) is more to be wishedthan expected, that it may be so considered and examined. experience ona former occasion teaches us not to be too sanguine in such hopes. itis not yet forgotten that well-grounded apprehensions of imminent dangerinduced the people of america to form the memorable congress of 1774.that body recommended certain measures to their constituents, and theevent proved their wisdom; yet it is fresh in our memories how soon thepress began to teem with pamphlets and weekly papers against those verymeasures. not only many of the officers of government, who obeyed thedictates of personal interest, but others, from a mistaken estimate ofconsequences, or the undue influence of former attachments, or whoseambition aimed at objects which did not correspond with the public good,were indefatigable in their efforts to persuade the people to rejectthe advice of that patriotic congress. many, indeed, were deceivedand deluded, but the great majority of the people reasoned and decidedjudiciously; and happy they are in reflecting that they did so.\", \"they considered that the congress was composed of many wise andexperienced men. that, being convened from different parts of thecountry, they brought with them and communicated to each other a varietyof useful information. that, in the course of the time they passedtogether in inquiring into and discussing the true interests of theircountry, they must have acquired very accurate knowledge on thathead. that they were individually interested in the public liberty andprosperity, and therefore that it was not less their inclination thantheir duty to recommend only such measures as, after the most maturedeliberation, they really thought prudent and advisable.\", \"these and similar considerations then induced the people to rely greatlyon the judgment and integrity of the congress; and they took theiradvice, notwithstanding the various arts and endeavors used to deterthem from it. but if the people at large had reason to confide in themen of that congress, few of whom had been fully tried or generallyknown, still greater reason have they now to respect the judgment andadvice of the convention, for it is well known that some of the mostdistinguished members of that congress, who have been since tried andjustly approved for patriotism and abilities, and who have grown old inacquiring political information, were also members of this convention,and carried into it their accumulated knowledge and experience.\", \"it is worthy of remark that not only the first, but every succeedingcongress, as well as the late convention, have invariably joined withthe people in thinking that the prosperity of america depended on itsunion. to preserve and perpetuate it was the great object of the peoplein forming that convention, and it is also the great object of the planwhich the convention has advised them to adopt. with what propriety,therefore, or for what good purposes, are attempts at this particularperiod made by some men to depreciate the importance of the union? orwhy is it suggested that three or four confederacies would be betterthan one? i am persuaded in my own mind that the people have alwaysthought right on this subject, and that their universal and uniformattachment to the cause of the union rests on great and weighty reasons,which i shall endeavor to develop and explain in some ensuing papers.they who promote the idea of substituting a number of distinctconfederacies in the room of the plan of the convention, seem clearly toforesee that the rejection of it would put the continuance of theunion in the utmost jeopardy. that certainly would be the case, and isincerely wish that it may be as clearly foreseen by every good citizen,that whenever the dissolution of the union arrives, america will havereason to exclaim, in the words of the poet: \\\"farewell! a long farewellto all my greatness.\\\"\", \"publius\"]\n",
       " [\"federalist no. 3\", \"it is not a new observation that the people of any country (if, likethe americans, intelligent and wellinformed) seldom adopt and steadilypersevere for many years in an erroneous opinion respecting theirinterests. that consideration naturally tends to create great respectfor the high opinion which the people of america have so long anduniformly entertained of the importance of their continuing firmlyunited under one federal government, vested with sufficient powers forall general and national purposes.\", \"the more attentively i consider and investigate the reasons which appearto have given birth to this opinion, the more i become convinced thatthey are cogent and conclusive.\", \"among the many objects to which a wise and free people find it necessaryto direct their attention, that of providing for their safety seems tobe the first. the safety of the people doubtless has relation to a greatvariety of circumstances and considerations, and consequentlyaffords great latitude to those who wish to define it precisely andcomprehensively.\", \"at present i mean only to consider it as it respects security for thepreservation of peace and tranquillity, as well as against dangers fromforeign arms and influence, as from dangers of the like kind arisingfrom domestic causes. as the former of these comes first in order, itis proper it should be the first discussed. let us therefore proceed toexamine whether the people are not right in their opinion that a cordialunion, under an efficient national government, affords them the bestsecurity that can be devised against hostilities from abroad.\", \"the number of wars which have happened or will happen in the world willalways be found to be in proportion to the number and weight of thecauses, whether real or pretended, which provoke or invite them. if thisremark be just, it becomes useful to inquire whether so many just causesof war are likely to be given by united america as by disunited america;for if it should turn out that united america will probably give thefewest, then it will follow that in this respect the union tends most topreserve the people in a state of peace with other nations.\", \"the just causes of war, for the most part, arise either from violationof treaties or from direct violence. america has already formed treatieswith no less than six foreign nations, and all of them, except prussia,are maritime, and therefore able to annoy and injure us. she has alsoextensive commerce with portugal, spain, and britain, and, with respectto the two latter, has, in addition, the circumstance of neighborhood toattend to.\", \"it is of high importance to the peace of america that she observe thelaws of nations towards all these powers, and to me it appears evidentthat this will be more perfectly and punctually done by one nationalgovernment than it could be either by thirteen separate states or bythree or four distinct confederacies.\", \"because when once an efficient national government is established, thebest men in the country will not only consent to serve, but also willgenerally be appointed to manage it; for, although town or country,or other contracted influence, may place men in state assemblies,or senates, or courts of justice, or executive departments, yet moregeneral and extensive reputation for talents and other qualificationswill be necessary to recommend men to offices under the nationalgovernment,--especially as it will have the widest field for choice, andnever experience that want of proper persons which is not uncommon insome of the states. hence, it will result that the administration,the political counsels, and the judicial decisions of the nationalgovernment will be more wise, systematical, and judicious than those ofindividual states, and consequently more satisfactory with respect toother nations, as well as more safe with respect to us.\", \"because, under the national government, treaties and articles oftreaties, as well as the laws of nations, will always be expounded inone sense and executed in the same manner,--whereas, adjudications onthe same points and questions, in thirteen states, or in three or fourconfederacies, will not always accord or be consistent; and that, aswell from the variety of independent courts and judges appointed bydifferent and independent governments, as from the different local lawsand interests which may affect and influence them. the wisdom ofthe convention, in committing such questions to the jurisdiction andjudgment of courts appointed by and responsible only to one nationalgovernment, cannot be too much commended.\", \"because the prospect of present loss or advantage may often tempt thegoverning party in one or two states to swerve from good faith andjustice; but those temptations, not reaching the other states, andconsequently having little or no influence on the national government,the temptation will be fruitless, and good faith and justice bepreserved. the case of the treaty of peace with britain adds greatweight to this reasoning.\", \"because, even if the governing party in a state should be disposed toresist such temptations, yet as such temptations may, and commonly do,result from circumstances peculiar to the state, and may affect a greatnumber of the inhabitants, the governing party may not always beable, if willing, to prevent the injustice meditated, or to punish theaggressors. but the national government, not being affected by thoselocal circumstances, will neither be induced to commit the wrongthemselves, nor want power or inclination to prevent or punish itscommission by others.\", \"so far, therefore, as either designed or accidental violations oftreaties and the laws of nations afford just causes of war, they areless to be apprehended under one general government than under severallesser ones, and in that respect the former most favors the safety ofthe people.\", \"as to those just causes of war which proceed from direct and unlawfulviolence, it appears equally clear to me that one good nationalgovernment affords vastly more security against dangers of that sortthan can be derived from any other quarter.\", \"because such violences are more frequently caused by the passions andinterests of a part than of the whole; of one or two states than of theunion. not a single indian war has yet been occasioned by aggressions ofthe present federal government, feeble as it is; but there are severalinstances of indian hostilities having been provoked by the improperconduct of individual states, who, either unable or unwilling torestrain or punish offenses, have given occasion to the slaughter ofmany innocent inhabitants.\", \"the neighborhood of spanish and british territories, bordering on somestates and not on others, naturally confines the causes of quarrel moreimmediately to the borderers. the bordering states, if any, will bethose who, under the impulse of sudden irritation, and a quick sense ofapparent interest or injury, will be most likely, by direct violence,to excite war with these nations; and nothing can so effectually obviatethat danger as a national government, whose wisdom and prudence willnot be diminished by the passions which actuate the parties immediatelyinterested.\", \"but not only fewer just causes of war will be given by the nationalgovernment, but it will also be more in their power to accommodate andsettle them amicably. they will be more temperate and cool, and in thatrespect, as well as in others, will be more in capacity to act advisedlythan the offending state. the pride of states, as well as of men,naturally disposes them to justify all their actions, and opposes theiracknowledging, correcting, or repairing their errors and offenses. thenational government, in such cases, will not be affected by this pride,but will proceed with moderation and candor to consider and decide onthe means most proper to extricate them from the difficulties whichthreaten them.\", \"besides, it is well known that acknowledgments, explanations, andcompensations are often accepted as satisfactory from a strong unitednation, which would be rejected as unsatisfactory if offered by a stateor confederacy of little consideration or power.\", \"in the year 1685, the state of genoa having offended louis,endeavored to appease him. he demanded that they should send their doge,or chief magistrate, accompanied by four of their senators, to france,to ask his pardon and receive his terms. they were obliged to submit toit for the sake of peace. would he on any occasion either have demandedor have received the like humiliation from spain, or britain, or anyother powerful nation?\", \"publius\"]\n",

and those reasons showthat such causes would not only be more rarely given, but would also bemore easily accommodated, by a national government than either by thestate governments or the proposed little confederacies.\", \"but the safety of the people of america against dangers from foreignforce depends not only on their forbearing to give just causes of warto other nations, but also on their placing and continuing themselves insuch a situation as not to invite hostility or insult; for it need notbe observed that there are pretended as well as just causes of war.\", \"it is too true, however disgraceful it may be to human nature, thatnations in general will make war whenever they have a prospect ofgetting anything by it; nay, absolute monarchs will often make war whentheir nations are to get nothing by it, but for the purposes and objectsmerely personal, such as thirst for military glory, revenge for personalaffronts, ambition, or private compacts to aggrandize or support theirparticular families or partisans. these and a variety of other motives,which affect only the mind of the sovereign, often lead him to engage inwars not sanctified by justice or the voice and interests of his people.but, independent of these inducements to war, which are more prevalentin absolute monarchies, but which well deserve our attention, there areothers which affect nations as often as kings;

but now a comparativelysmall force of disciplined troops, acting on the defensive, with the aidof posts, is able to impede, and finally to frustrate, the enterprisesof one much more considerable. the history of war, in that quarterof the globe, is no longer a history of nations subdued and empiresoverturned, but of towns taken and retaken; of battles that decidenothing; of retreats more beneficial than victories; of much effort andlittle acquisition.\", \"in this country the scene would be altogether reversed. the jealousyof military establishments would postpone them as long as possible.the want of fortifications, leaving the frontiers of one state opento another, would facilitate inroads. the populous states would, withlittle difficulty, overrun their less populous neighbors. conquestswould be as easy to be made as difficult to be retained. war, therefore,would be desultory and predatory. plunder and devastation ever march inthe train of irregulars. the calamities of individuals would make theprincipal figure in the events which would characterize our militaryexploits.\", \"this picture is not too highly wrought; though, i confess, it would notlong remain a just one. safety from external danger is the most powerfuldirector of national conduct. even the ardent love of liberty will,after a time, give way to its dictates. the violent destruction of lifeand property incident to war, the continual effort and alarm attendanton a state of continual danger, will compel nations the most attached toliberty to resort for repose and security to institutions which have atendency to destroy their civil and political rights. to be more safe,they at length become willing to run the risk of being less free.\", \"the institutions chiefly alluded to are standing armies and thecorrespondent appendages of military establishments. standing armies,it is said, are not provided against in the new constitution;

and the suffragesof the people being more free, will be more likely to centre in men whopossess the most attractive merit and the most diffusive and establishedcharacters.\", \"it must be confessed that in this, as in most other cases, there is amean, on both sides of which inconveniences will be found to lie.by enlarging too much the number of electors, you render therepresentatives too little acquainted with all their local circumstancesand lesser interests; as by reducing it too much, you render him undulyattached to these, and too little fit to comprehend and pursue great andnational objects. the federal constitution forms a happy combination inthis respect; the great and aggregate interests being referred to thenational, the local and particular to the state legislatures.\", \"the other point of difference is, the greater number of citizensand extent of territory which may be brought within the compass ofrepublican than of democratic government;

and the public would be at noloss to determine what part had been performed by the different actors.the blame of a bad nomination would fall upon the president singly andabsolutely. the censure of rejecting a good one would lie entirely atthe door of the senate;

but it is not known to what extent,or in what manner he exercises it; nor upon what occasions he iscontradicted or opposed. the censure of a bad appointment, on account ofthe uncertainty of its author, and for want of a determinate object, hasneither poignancy nor duration. and while an unbounded field for cabaland intrigue lies open, all idea of responsibility is lost. the mostthat the public can know, is that the governor claims the right ofnomination; that two out of the inconsiderable number of four mencan too often be managed without much difficulty; that if some of themembers of a particular council should happen to be of an uncomplyingcharacter, it is frequently not impossible to get rid of theiropposition by regulating the times of meeting in such a manner as torender their attendance inconvenient; and that from whatever cause itmay proceed, a great number of very improper appointments are from timeto time made. whether a governor of this state avails himself of theascendant he must necessarily have, in this delicate and important partof the administration, to prefer to offices men who are best qualifiedfor them, or whether he prostitutes that advantage to the advancement ofpersons whose chief merit is their implicit devotion to his will, and tothe support of a despicable and dangerous system of personal influence,are questions which, unfortunately for the community, can only be thesubjects of speculation and conjecture.\", \"every mere council of appointment, however constituted, will be aconclave, in which cabal and intrigue will have their full scope. theirnumber, without an unwarrantable increase of expense, cannot be largeenough to preclude a facility of combination. and as each member willhave his friends and connections to provide for, the desire of mutualgratification will beget a scandalous bartering of votes and bargainingfor places. the private attachments of one man might easily besatisfied; but to satisfy the private attachments of a dozen, or oftwenty men, would occasion a monopoly of all the principal employmentsof the government in a few families, and would lead more directly to anaristocracy or an oligarchy than any measure that could be contrived.if, to avoid an accumulation of offices, there was to be a frequentchange in the persons who were to compose the council, this wouldinvolve the mischiefs of a mutable administration in their full extent.such a council would also be more liable to executive influence thanthe senate, because they would be fewer in number, and would act lessimmediately under the public inspection. such a council, in fine, asa substitute for the plan of the convention, would be productive of anincrease of expense, a multiplication of the evils which spring fromfavoritism and intrigue in the distribution of public honors, a decreaseof stability in the administration of the government, and a diminutionof the security against an undue influence of the executive. and yetsuch a council has been warmly contended for as an essential amendmentin the proposed constitution.\", \"i could not with propriety conclude my observations on the subject ofappointments without taking notice of a scheme for which there haveappeared some, though but few advocates;

in a republic it isa no less excellent barrier to the encroachments and oppressions of therepresentative body. and it is the best expedient which can bedevised in any government, to secure a steady, upright, and impartialadministration of the laws.\", \"whoever attentively considers the different departments of power mustperceive, that, in a government in which they are separated from eachother, the judiciary, from the nature of its functions, will always bethe least dangerous to the political rights of the constitution; becauseit will be least in a capacity to annoy or injure them. the executivenot only dispenses the honors, but holds the sword of the community.the legislature not only commands the purse, but prescribes the rulesby which the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated. thejudiciary, on the contrary, has no influence over either the sword orthe purse; no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of thesociety; and can take no active resolution whatever. it may truly besaid to have neither force nor will, but merely judgment; and mustultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for theefficacy of its judgments.\", \"this simple view of the matter suggests several important consequences.it proves incontestably, that the judiciary is beyond comparison theweakest of the three departments of power; that it can never attackwith success either of the other two; and that all possible care isrequisite to enable it to defend itself against their attacks. itequally proves, that though individual oppression may now and thenproceed from the courts of justice, the general liberty of the peoplecan never be endangered from that quarter; i mean so long as thejudiciary remains truly distinct from both the legislature and theexecutive. for i agree, that \\\"there is no liberty, if the power ofjudging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers.\\\"and it proves, in the last place, that as liberty can have nothing tofear from the judiciary alone, but would have every thing to fear fromits union with either of the other departments; that as all the effectsof such a union must ensue from a dependence of the former on thelatter, notwithstanding a nominal and apparent separation; that as, fromthe natural feebleness of the judiciary, it is in continual jeopardy ofbeing overpowered, awed, or influenced by its co-ordinate branches; andthat as nothing can contribute so much to its firmness and independenceas permanency in office, this quality may therefore be justly regardedas an indispensable ingredient in its constitution, and, in a greatmeasure, as the citadel of the public justice and the public security.\", \"the complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarlyessential in a limited constitution. by a limited constitution, iunderstand one which contains certain specified exceptions to thelegislative authority; such, for instance, as that it shall pass nobills of attainder, no ex post facto laws, and the like. limitationsof this kind can be preserved in practice no other way than through themedium of courts of justice, whose duty it must be to declare all actscontrary to the manifest tenor of the constitution void. without this,all the reservations of particular rights or privileges would amount tonothing.\"  …  \"this exercise of judicial discretion, in determining between twocontradictory laws, is exemplified in a familiar instance. it notuncommonly happens, that there are two statutes existing at one time,clashing in whole or in part with each other, and neither of themcontaining any repealing clause or expression. in such a case, it is theprovince of the courts to liquidate and fix their meaning and operation.so far as they can, by any fair construction, be reconciled to eachother, reason and law conspire to dictate that this should be done;where this is impracticable, it becomes a matter of necessity to giveeffect to one, in exclusion of the other. the rule which has obtained inthe courts for determining their relative validity is, that the last inorder of time shall be preferred to the first. but this is a mere ruleof construction, not derived from any positive law, but from the natureand reason of the thing. it is a rule not enjoined upon the courts bylegislative provision, but adopted by themselves, as consonant to truthand propriety, for the direction of their conduct as interpreters of thelaw. they thought it reasonable, that between the interfering acts of anequal authority, that which was the last indication of its will shouldhave the preference.\", \"but in regard to the interfering acts of a superior and subordinateauthority, of an original and derivative power, the nature and reason ofthe thing indicate the converse of that rule as proper to be followed.they teach us that the prior act of a superior ought to be preferred tothe subsequent act of an inferior and subordinate authority; and thataccordingly, whenever a particular statute contravenes the constitution,it will be the duty of the judicial tribunals to adhere to the latterand disregard the former.\", \"it can be of no weight to say that the courts, on the pretense of arepugnancy, may substitute their own pleasure to the constitutionalintentions of the legislature. this might as well happen in the caseof two contradictory statutes; or it might as well happen in everyadjudication upon any single statute. the courts must declare the senseof the law; and if they should be disposed to exercise will instead ofjudgment, the consequence would equally be the substitution of theirpleasure to that of the legislative body. the observation, if it proveany thing, would prove that there ought to be no judges distinct fromthat body.\", \"if, then, the courts of justice are to be considered as the bulwarksof a limited constitution against legislative encroachments, thisconsideration will afford a strong argument for the permanent tenure ofjudicial offices, since nothing will contribute so much as this to thatindependent spirit in the judges which must be essential to the faithfulperformance of so arduous a duty.\", \"this independence of the judges is equally requisite to guard theconstitution and the rights of individuals from the effects of those illhumors, which the arts of designing men, or the influence of particularconjunctures, sometimes disseminate among the people themselves, andwhich, though they speedily give place to better information, and moredeliberate reflection, have a tendency, in the meantime, to occasiondangerous innovations in the government, and serious oppressions of theminor party in the community. though i trust the friends of the proposedconstitution will never concur with its enemies, in questioning thatfundamental principle of republican government, which admits the rightof the people to alter or abolish the established constitution, wheneverthey find it inconsistent with their happiness, yet it is not to beinferred from this principle, that the representatives of the people,whenever a momentary inclination happens to lay hold of a majority oftheir constituents, incompatible with the provisions in the existingconstitution, would, on that account, be justifiable in a violation ofthose provisions; or that the courts would be under a greater obligationto connive at infractions in this shape, than when they had proceededwholly from the cabals of the representative body. until the peoplehave, by some solemn and authoritative act, annulled or changed theestablished form, it is binding upon themselves collectively, as wellas individually; and no presumption, or even knowledge, of theirsentiments, can warrant their representatives in a departure from it,prior to such an act. but it is easy to see, that it would require anuncommon portion of fortitude in the judges to do their duty as faithfulguardians of the constitution, where legislative invasions of it hadbeen instigated by the major voice of the community.\", \"but it is not with a view to infractions of the constitution only, thatthe independence of the judges may be an essential safeguard against theeffects of occasional ill humors in the society. these sometimes extendno farther than to the injury of the private rights of particularclasses of citizens, by unjust and partial laws. here also the firmnessof the judicial magistracy is of vast importance in mitigating theseverity and confining the operation of such laws. it not only servesto moderate the immediate mischiefs of those which may have been passed,but it operates as a check upon the legislative body in passing them;who, perceiving that obstacles to the success of iniquitous intentionare to be expected from the scruples of the courts, are in a mannercompelled, by the very motives of the injustice they meditate, toqualify their attempts. this is a circumstance calculated to have moreinfluence upon the character of our governments, than but few may beaware of. the benefits of the integrity and moderation of the judiciaryhave already been felt in more states than one; and though they may havedispleased those whose sinister expectations they may have disappointed,they must have commanded the esteem and applause of all the virtuousand disinterested. considerate men, of every description, ought to prizewhatever will tend to beget or fortify that temper in the courts: as noman can be sure that he may not be to-morrow the victim of a spirit ofinjustice, by which he may be a gainer to-day. and every man mustnow feel, that the inevitable tendency of such a spirit is to sap thefoundations of public and private confidence, and to introduce in itsstead universal distrust and distress.\", \"that inflexible and uniform adherence to the rights of the constitution,and of individuals, which we perceive to be indispensable in the courtsof justice, can certainly not be expected from judges who hold theiroffices by a temporary commission. periodical appointments, howeverregulated, or by whomsoever made, would, in some way or other, befatal to their necessary independence. if the power of making them wascommitted either to the executive or legislature, there would be dangerof an improper complaisance to the branch which possessed it; if toboth, there would be an unwillingness to hazard the displeasure ofeither; if to the people, or to persons chosen by them for the specialpurpose, there would be too great a disposition to consult popularity,to justify a reliance that nothing would be consulted but theconstitution and the laws.\", \"there is yet a further and a weightier reason for the permanency ofthe judicial offices, which is deducible from the nature of thequalifications they require. it has been frequently remarked, with greatpropriety, that a voluminous code of laws is one of the inconveniencesnecessarily connected with the advantages of a free government. to avoidan arbitrary discretion in the courts, it is indispensable that theyshould be bound down by strict rules and precedents, which serve todefine and point out their duty in every particular case that comesbefore them; and it will readily be conceived from the variety ofcontroversies which grow out of the folly and wickedness of mankind,that the records of those precedents must unavoidably swell to a veryconsiderable bulk, and must demand long and laborious study to acquire acompetent knowledge of them. hence it is, that there can be but few menin the society who will have sufficient skill in the laws to qualifythem for the stations of judges. and making the proper deductions forthe ordinary depravity of human nature, the number must be still smallerof those who unite the requisite integrity with the requisite knowledge.these considerations apprise us, that the government can have no greatoption between fit character; and that a temporary duration in office,which would naturally discourage such characters from quitting alucrative line of practice to accept a seat on the bench, would have atendency to throw the administration of justice into hands less able,and less well qualified, to conduct it with utility and dignity. inthe present circumstances of this country, and in those in which it islikely to be for a long time to come, the disadvantages on this scorewould be greater than they may at first sight appear; but it must beconfessed, that they are far inferior to those which present themselvesunder the other aspects of the subject.\", \"upon the whole, there can be no room to doubt that the convention actedwisely in copying from the models of those constitutions which haveestablished good behavior as the tenure of their judicial offices, inpoint of duration;

and informs us, at the same time,of the vast influence of that institution in appeasing the disorders andestablishing the tranquillity of the empire. this was a court investedwith authority to decide finally all differences among the members ofthe germanic body.\", \"a method of terminating territorial disputes between the states, underthe authority of the federal head, was not unattended to, even in theimperfect system by which they have been hitherto held together. butthere are many other sources, besides interfering claims of boundary,from which bickerings and animosities may spring up among the members ofthe union. to some of these we have been witnesses in the course of ourpast experience. it will readily be conjectured that i allude to thefraudulent laws which have been passed in too many of the states. andthough the proposed constitution establishes particular guards againstthe repetition of those instances which have heretofore made theirappearance, yet it is warrantable to apprehend that the spirit whichproduced them will assume new shapes, that could not be foreseen norspecifically provided against. whatever practices may have a tendencyto disturb the harmony between the states, are proper objects of federalsuperintendence and control.\", \"it may be esteemed the basis of the union, that \\\"the citizens of eachstate shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizensof the several states.\\\" and if it be a just principle that everygovernment ought to possess the means of executing its own provisionsby its own authority, it will follow, that in order to the inviolablemaintenance of that equality of privileges and immunities to which thecitizens of the union will be entitled, the national judiciary ought topreside in all cases in which one state or its citizens are opposedto another state or its citizens. to secure the full effect of sofundamental a provision against all evasion and subterfuge, it isnecessary that its construction should be committed to that tribunalwhich, having no local attachments, will be likely to be impartialbetween the different states and their citizens, and which, owing itsofficial existence to the union, will never be likely to feel any biasinauspicious to the principles on which it is founded.\"  …  \"it has also been asked, what need of the word \\\"equity\\\". what equitablecauses can grow out of the constitution and laws of the united states?there is hardly a subject of litigation between individuals, which maynot involve those ingredients of fraud, accident, trust, or hardship,which would render the matter an object of equitable rather than oflegal jurisdiction, as the distinction is known and established inseveral of the states. it is the peculiar province, for instance, of acourt of equity to relieve against what are called hard bargains: theseare contracts in which, though there may have been no direct fraud ordeceit, sufficient to invalidate them in a court of law, yet theremay have been some undue and unconscionable advantage taken of thenecessities or misfortunes of one of the parties, which a courtof equity would not tolerate. in such cases, where foreigners wereconcerned on either side, it would be impossible for the federaljudicatories to do justice without an equitable as well as a legaljurisdiction. agreements to convey lands claimed under the grants ofdifferent states, may afford another example of the necessity of anequitable jurisdiction in the federal courts. this reasoning may not beso palpable in those states where the formal and technical distinctionbetween law and equity is not maintained, as in this state, where it isexemplified by every day's practice.\", \"the judiciary authority of the union is to extend:\", \"second. to treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority ofthe united states, and to all cases affecting ambassadors, otherpublic ministers, and consuls. these belong to the fourth class ofthe enumerated cases, as they have an evident connection with thepreservation of the national peace.\", \"third. to cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. these form,altogether, the fifth of the enumerated classes of causes proper for thecognizance of the national courts.\", \"fourth. to controversies to which the united states shall be a party.these constitute the third of those classes.\", \"fifth. to controversies between two or more states;

and this partof the british government has been imitated in the state constitutionsin general. the parliament of great britain, and the legislatures ofthe several states, can at any time rectify, by law, the exceptionabledecisions of their respective courts. but the errors and usurpationsof the supreme court of the united states will be uncontrollableand remediless.\\\" this, upon examination, will be found to be made upaltogether of false reasoning upon misconceived fact.\", \"in the first place, there is not a syllable in the plan underconsideration which directly empowers the national courts to construethe laws according to the spirit of the constitution, or which givesthem any greater latitude in this respect than may be claimed by thecourts of every state. i admit, however, that the constitution ought tobe the standard of construction for the laws, and that wherever there isan evident opposition, the laws ought to give place to the constitution.but this doctrine is not deducible from any circumstance peculiar tothe plan of the convention, but from the general theory of a limitedconstitution; and as far as it is true, is equally applicable tomost, if not to all the state governments. there can be no objection,therefore, on this account, to the federal judicature which will not lieagainst the local judicatures in general, and which will not serve tocondemn every constitution that attempts to set bounds to legislativediscretion.\", \"but perhaps the force of the objection may be thought to consist in theparticular organization of the supreme court; in its being composed ofa distinct body of magistrates, instead of being one of the branches ofthe legislature, as in the government of great britain and that of thestate. to insist upon this point, the authors of the objection mustrenounce the meaning they have labored to annex to the celebratedmaxim, requiring a separation of the departments of power. it shall,nevertheless, be conceded to them, agreeably to the interpretation givento that maxim in the course of these papers, that it is not violated byvesting the ultimate power of judging in a part of the legislative body.but though this be not an absolute violation of that excellent rule,yet it verges so nearly upon it, as on this account alone to be lesseligible than the mode preferred by the convention. from a body whichhad even a partial agency in passing bad laws, we could rarely expecta disposition to temper and moderate them in the application. thesame spirit which had operated in making them, would be too apt ininterpreting them; still less could it be expected that men who hadinfringed the constitution in the character of legislators, would bedisposed to repair the breach in the character of judges. nor is thisall. every reason which recommends the tenure of good behavior forjudicial offices, militates against placing the judiciary power, inthe last resort, in a body composed of men chosen for a limited period.there is an absurdity in referring the determination of causes, in thefirst instance, to judges of permanent standing; in the last, to thoseof a temporary and mutable constitution. and there is a still greaterabsurdity in subjecting the decisions of men, selected for theirknowledge of the laws, acquired by long and laborious study, to therevision and control of men who, for want of the same advantage, cannotbut be deficient in that knowledge. the members of the legislature willrarely be chosen with a view to those qualifications which fit men forthe stations of judges; and as, on this account, there will be greatreason to apprehend all the ill consequences of defective information,so, on account of the natural propensity of such bodies to partydivisions, there will be no less reason to fear that the pestilentialbreath of faction may poison the fountains of justice. the habit ofbeing continually marshalled on opposite sides will be too apt to stiflethe voice both of law and of equity.\", \"these considerations teach us to applaud the wisdom of those states whohave committed the judicial power, in the last resort, not to a part ofthe legislature, but to distinct and independent bodies of men. contraryto the supposition of those who have represented the plan of theconvention, in this respect, as novel and unprecedented, it is but acopy of the constitutions of new hampshire, massachusetts, pennsylvania,delaware, maryland, virginia, north carolina, south carolina, andgeorgia; and the preference which has been given to those models ishighly to be commended.\", \"it is not true, in the second place, that the parliament of greatbritain, or the legislatures of the particular states, can rectify theexceptionable decisions of their respective courts, in any other sensethan might be done by a future legislature of the united states. thetheory, neither of the british, nor the state constitutions, authorizesthe revisal of a judicial sentence by a legislative act. nor is thereany thing in the proposed constitution, more than in either of them,by which it is forbidden. in the former, as well as in the latter, theimpropriety of the thing, on the general principles of law and reason,is the sole obstacle. a legislature, without exceeding its province,cannot reverse a determination once made in a particular case; though itmay prescribe a new rule for future cases. this is the principle, and itapplies in all its consequences, exactly in the same manner and extent,to the state governments, as to the national government now underconsideration. not the least difference can be pointed out in any viewof the subject.\", \"it may in the last place be observed that the supposed danger ofjudiciary encroachments on the legislative authority, which has beenupon many occasions reiterated, is in reality a phantom. particularmisconstructions and contraventions of the will of the legislature maynow and then happen; but they can never be so extensive as to amount toan inconvenience, or in any sensible degree to affect the order of thepolitical system. this may be inferred with certainty, from the generalnature of the judicial power, from the objects to which it relates, fromthe manner in which it is exercised, from its comparative weakness, andfrom its total incapacity to support its usurpations by force. and theinference is greatly fortified by the consideration of the importantconstitutional check which the power of instituting impeachments in onepart of the legislative body, and of determining upon them in the other,would give to that body upon the members of the judicial department.this is alone a complete security. there never can be danger that thejudges, by a series of deliberate usurpations on the authority of thelegislature, would hazard the united resentment of the body intrustedwith it, while this body was possessed of the means of punishing theirpresumption, by degrading them from their stations. while this ought toremove all apprehensions on the subject, it affords, at the same time,a cogent argument for constituting the senate a court for the trial ofimpeachments.\"  …  \"the supreme court is to be invested with original jurisdiction, only \\\"incases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls, andthose in which a state shall be a party.\\\" public ministers of everyclass are the immediate representatives of their sovereigns. allquestions in which they are concerned are so directly connected withthe public peace, that, as well for the preservation of this, as out ofrespect to the sovereignties they represent, it is both expedient andproper that such questions should be submitted in the first instanceto the highest judicatory of the nation. though consuls have not instrictness a diplomatic character, yet as they are the public agentsof the nations to which they belong, the same observation is in a greatmeasure applicable to them. in cases in which a state might happen to bea party, it would ill suit its dignity to be turned over to an inferiortribunal.\", \"though it may rather be a digression from the immediate subject of thispaper, i shall take occasion to mention here a supposition which hasexcited some alarm upon very mistaken grounds. it has been suggestedthat an assignment of the public securities of one state to the citizensof another, would enable them to prosecute that state in the federalcourts for the amount of those securities; a suggestion which thefollowing considerations prove to be without foundation.\", \"it is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to thesuit of an individual without its consent. this is the general sense,and the general practice of mankind; and the exemption, as one of theattributes of sovereignty, is now enjoyed by the government of everystate in the union. unless, therefore, there is a surrender of thisimmunity in the plan of the convention, it will remain with the states,and the danger intimated must be merely ideal. the circumstanceswhich are necessary to produce an alienation of state sovereigntywere discussed in considering the article of taxation, and need not berepeated here. a recurrence to the principles there established willsatisfy us, that there is no color to pretend that the state governmentswould, by the adoption of that plan, be divested of the privilege ofpaying their own debts in their own way, free from every constraintbut that which flows from the obligations of good faith. the contractsbetween a nation and individuals are only binding on the conscienceof the sovereign, and have no pretensions to a compulsive force. theyconfer no right of action, independent of the sovereign will. to whatpurpose would it be to authorize suits against states for the debts theyowe? how could recoveries be enforced? it is evident, it could not bedone without waging war against the contracting state; and to ascribeto the federal courts, by mere implication, and in destruction of apre-existing right of the state governments, a power which would involvesuch a consequence, would be altogether forced and unwarrantable.\", \"let us resume the train of our observations. we have seen that theoriginal jurisdiction of the supreme court would be confined to twoclasses of causes, and those of a nature rarely to occur. in all othercases of federal cognizance, the original jurisdiction would appertainto the inferior tribunals; and the supreme court would have nothing morethan an appellate jurisdiction, \\\"with such exceptions and under suchregulations as the congress shall make.\\\"\", \"the propriety of this appellate jurisdiction has been scarcely calledin question in regard to matters of law; but the clamors have been loudagainst it as applied to matters of fact. some well-intentioned men inthis state, deriving their notions from the language and forms whichobtain in our courts, have been induced to consider it as an impliedsupersedure of the trial by jury, in favor of the civil-law mode oftrial, which prevails in our courts of admiralty, probate, and chancery.a technical sense has been affixed to the term \\\"appellate,\\\" which, inour law parlance, is commonly used in reference to appeals in the courseof the civil law. but if i am not misinformed, the same meaning wouldnot be given to it in any part of new england. there an appeal from onejury to another, is familiar both in language and practice, and is evena matter of course, until there have been two verdicts on one side. theword \\\"appellate,\\\" therefore, will not be understood in the same sense innew england as in new york, which shows the impropriety of a technicalinterpretation derived from the jurisprudence of any particular state.the expression, taken in the abstract, denotes nothing more than thepower of one tribunal to review the proceedings of another, either asto the law or fact, or both. the mode of doing it may depend on ancientcustom or legislative provision (in a new government it must depend onthe latter), and may be with or without the aid of a jury, as may bejudged advisable. if, therefore, the re-examination of a fact oncedetermined by a jury, should in any case be admitted under the proposedconstitution, it may be so regulated as to be done by a second jury,either by remanding the cause to the court below for a second trial ofthe fact, or by directing an issue immediately out of the supreme court.\", \"but it does not follow that the re-examination of a fact onceascertained by a jury, will be permitted in the supreme court. why maynot it be said, with the strictest propriety, when a writ of error isbrought from an inferior to a superior court of law in this state, thatthe latter has jurisdiction of the fact as well as the law? it is trueit cannot institute a new inquiry concerning the fact, but it takescognizance of it as it appears upon the record, and pronounces the lawarising upon it. this is jurisdiction of both fact and law; nor isit even possible to separate them. though the common-law courts of thisstate ascertain disputed facts by a jury, yet they unquestionably havejurisdiction of both fact and law; and accordingly when the former isagreed in the pleadings, they have no recourse to a jury, but proceedat once to judgment. i contend, therefore, on this ground, that theexpressions, \\\"appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact,\\\" do notnecessarily imply a re-examination in the supreme court of facts decidedby juries in the inferior courts.\", \"the following train of ideas may well be imagined to have influencedthe convention, in relation to this particular provision. the appellatejurisdiction of the supreme court (it may have been argued) will extendto causes determinable in different modes, some in the course of thecommon law, others in the course of the civil law. in the former,the revision of the law only will be, generally speaking, the properprovince of the supreme court; in the latter, the re-examination of thefact is agreeable to usage, and in some cases, of which prize causes arean example, might be essential to the preservation of the public peace.it is therefore necessary that the appellate jurisdiction should, incertain cases, extend in the broadest sense to matters of fact. it willnot answer to make an express exception of cases which shall have beenoriginally tried by a jury, because in the courts of some of the statesall causes are tried in this mode; and such an exception wouldpreclude the revision of matters of fact, as well where it might beproper, as where it might be improper. to avoid all inconveniencies,it will be safest to declare generally, that the supreme court shallpossess appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact, and that thisjurisdiction shall be subject to such exceptions and regulations as thenational legislature may prescribe. this will enable the governmentto modify it in such a manner as will best answer the ends of publicjustice and security.\", \"this view of the matter, at any rate, puts it out of all doubt thatthe supposed abolition of the trial by jury, by the operation of thisprovision, is fallacious and untrue. the legislature of the unitedstates would certainly have full power to provide, that in appeals tothe supreme court there should be no re-examination of facts where theyhad been tried in the original causes by juries. this would certainlybe an authorized exception; but if, for the reason already intimated, itshould be thought too extensive, it might be qualified with a limitationto such causes only as are determinable at common law in that mode oftrial.\", \"the amount of the observations hitherto made on the authority of thejudicial department is this: that it has been carefully restrictedto those causes which are manifestly proper for the cognizance of thenational judicature; that in the partition of this authority a verysmall portion of original jurisdiction has been preserved to the supremecourt, and the rest consigned to the subordinate tribunals; that thesupreme court will possess an appellate jurisdiction, both as to law andfact, in all the cases referred to them, both subject to any exceptionsand regulations which may be thought advisable; that this appellatejurisdiction does, in no case, abolish the trial by jury; and that anordinary degree of prudence and integrity in the national councilswill insure us solid advantages from the establishment of the proposedjudiciary, without exposing us to any of the inconveniences which havebeen predicted from that source.\", \"publius\"]\n",

'tis timeonly that can mature and perfect so compound a system, can liquidatethe meaning of all the parts, and can adjust them to each other in aharmonious and consistent whole.\", \"such questions, accordingly, have arisen upon the plan proposed by theconvention, and particularly concerning the judiciary department. theprincipal of these respect the situation of the state courts in regardto those causes which are to be submitted to federal jurisdiction.is this to be exclusive, or are those courts to possess a concurrentjurisdiction? if the latter, in what relation will they stand to thenational tribunals? these are inquiries which we meet with in the mouthsof men of sense, and which are certainly entitled to attention.\", \"the principles established in a former paper teach us that the stateswill retain all pre-existing authorities which may not be exclusivelydelegated to the federal head;

or where an authority is granted to the union, with whicha similar authority in the states would be utterly incompatible. thoughthese principles may not apply with the same force to the judiciary asto the legislative power, yet i am inclined to think that they are, inthe main, just with respect to the former, as well as the latter. andunder this impression, i shall lay it down as a rule, that the statecourts will retain the jurisdiction they now have, unless it appears tobe taken away in one of the enumerated modes.\", \"the only thing in the proposed constitution, which wears the appearanceof confining the causes of federal cognizance to the federal courts,is contained in this passage: \\\"the judicial power of the united statesshall be vested in one supreme court, and in such inferior courts asthe congress shall from time to time ordain and establish.\\\" this mighteither be construed to signify, that the supreme and subordinate courtsof the union should alone have the power of deciding those causes towhich their authority is to extend; or simply to denote, that the organsof the national judiciary should be one supreme court, and as manysubordinate courts as congress should think proper to appoint; or inother words, that the united states should exercise the judicial powerwith which they are to be invested, through one supreme tribunal, anda certain number of inferior ones, to be instituted by them. the firstexcludes, the last admits, the concurrent jurisdiction of the statetribunals;

fornot to allow the state courts a right of jurisdiction in such cases, canhardly be considered as the abridgment of a pre-existing authority. imean not therefore to contend that the united states, in the courseof legislation upon the objects intrusted to their direction, may notcommit the decision of causes arising upon a particular regulation tothe federal courts solely, if such a measure should be deemed expedient;but i hold that the state courts will be divested of no part of theirprimitive jurisdiction, further than may relate to an appeal; and iam even of opinion that in every case in which they were not expresslyexcluded by the future acts of the national legislature, they will ofcourse take cognizance of the causes to which those acts may give birth.this i infer from the nature of judiciary power, and from the generalgenius of the system. the judiciary power of every government looksbeyond its own local or municipal laws, and in civil cases lays holdof all subjects of litigation between parties within its jurisdiction,though the causes of dispute are relative to the laws of the mostdistant part of the globe. those of japan, not less than of new york,may furnish the objects of legal discussion to our courts. when inaddition to this we consider the state governments and the nationalgovernments, as they truly are, in the light of kindred systems, and asparts of one whole, the inference seems to be conclusive, that the statecourts would have a concurrent jurisdiction in all cases arising underthe laws of the union, where it was not expressly prohibited.\", \"here another question occurs: what relation would subsist between thenational and state courts in these instances of concurrent jurisdiction?i answer, that an appeal would certainly lie from the latter, to thesupreme court of the united states. the constitution in direct termsgives an appellate jurisdiction to the supreme court in all theenumerated cases of federal cognizance in which it is not to have anoriginal one, without a single expression to confine its operation tothe inferior federal courts. the objects of appeal, not the tribunalsfrom which it is to be made, are alone contemplated. from thiscircumstance, and from the reason of the thing, it ought to be construedto extend to the state tribunals. either this must be the case, or thelocal courts must be excluded from a concurrent jurisdiction in mattersof national concern, else the judiciary authority of the union may beeluded at the pleasure of every plaintiff or prosecutor. neither ofthese consequences ought, without evident necessity, to be involved; thelatter would be entirely inadmissible, as it would defeat some of themost important and avowed purposes of the proposed government, and wouldessentially embarrass its measures. nor do i perceive any foundation forsuch a supposition. agreeably to the remark already made, the nationaland state systems are to be regarded as one whole. the courts of thelatter will of course be natural auxiliaries to the execution of thelaws of the union, and an appeal from them will as naturally lie to thattribunal which is destined to unite and assimilate the principles ofnational justice and the rules of national decisions. the evident aimof the plan of the convention is, that all the causes of the specifiedclasses shall, for weighty public reasons, receive their original orfinal determination in the courts of the union. to confine, therefore,the general expressions giving appellate jurisdiction to the supremecourt, to appeals from the subordinate federal courts, instead ofallowing their extension to the state courts, would be to abridge thelatitude of the terms, in subversion of the intent, contrary to everysound rule of interpretation.\", \"but could an appeal be made to lie from the state courts to thesubordinate federal judicatories? this is another of the questionswhich have been raised, and of greater difficulty than the former. thefollowing considerations countenance the affirmative. the plan of theconvention, in the first place, authorizes the national legislature \\\"toconstitute tribunals inferior to the supreme court.\\\" it declares, inthe next place, that \\\"the judicial power of the united states shall bevested in one supreme court, and in such inferior courts as congressshall ordain and establish\\\"; and it then proceeds to enumerate the casesto which this judicial power shall extend. it afterwards divides thejurisdiction of the supreme court into original and appellate, butgives no definition of that of the subordinate courts. the only outlinesdescribed for them, are that they shall be \\\"inferior to the supremecourt,\\\" and that they shall not exceed the specified limits of thefederal judiciary. whether their authority shall be original orappellate, or both, is not declared. all this seems to be left to thediscretion of the legislature. and this being the case, i perceive atpresent no impediment to the establishment of an appeal from the statecourts to the subordinate national tribunals; and many advantagesattending the power of doing it may be imagined. it would diminish themotives to the multiplication of federal courts, and would admit ofarrangements calculated to contract the appellate jurisdiction of thesupreme court. the state tribunals may then be left with a more entirecharge of federal causes;

or, \\\"the expression of onething is the exclusion of another.\\\" hence, say they, as the constitutionhas established the trial by jury in criminal cases, and is silent inrespect to civil, this silence is an implied prohibition of trial byjury in regard to the latter.\", \"the rules of legal interpretation are rules of common sense, adopted bythe courts in the construction of the laws. the true test, therefore,of a just application of them is its conformity to the source from whichthey are derived. this being the case, let me ask if it is consistentwith common-sense to suppose that a provision obliging the legislativepower to commit the trial of criminal causes to juries, is a privationof its right to authorize or permit that mode of trial in othercases? is it natural to suppose, that a command to do one thing is aprohibition to the doing of another, which there was a previous power todo, and which is not incompatible with the thing commanded to be done?if such a supposition would be unnatural and unreasonable, it cannot berational to maintain that an injunction of the trial by jury in certaincases is an interdiction of it in others.\", \"a power to constitute courts is a power to prescribe the mode of trial;and consequently, if nothing was said in the constitution on the subjectof juries, the legislature would be at liberty either to adopt thatinstitution or to let it alone. this discretion, in regard to criminalcauses, is abridged by the express injunction of trial by jury in allsuch cases; but it is, of course, left at large in relation to civilcauses, there being a total silence on this head. the specification ofan obligation to try all criminal causes in a particular mode, excludesindeed the obligation or necessity of employing the same mode in civilcauses, but does not abridge the power of the legislature to exercisethat mode if it should be thought proper. the pretense, therefore, thatthe national legislature would not be at full liberty to submit all thecivil causes of federal cognizance to the determination of juries, is apretense destitute of all just foundation.\", \"from these observations this conclusion results: that the trial by juryin civil cases would not be abolished; and that the use attempted tobe made of the maxims which have been quoted, is contrary to reason andcommon-sense, and therefore not admissible. even if these maxims had aprecise technical sense, corresponding with the idea of those who employthem upon the present occasion, which, however, is not the case, theywould still be inapplicable to a constitution of government. in relationto such a subject, the natural and obvious sense of its provisions,apart from any technical rules, is the true criterion of construction.\", \"having now seen that the maxims relied upon will not bear the use madeof them, let us endeavor to ascertain their proper use and true meaning.this will be best done by examples. the plan of the convention declaresthat the power of congress, or, in other words, of the nationallegislature, shall extend to certain enumerated cases. thisspecification of particulars evidently excludes all pretension to ageneral legislative authority, because an affirmative grant of specialpowers would be absurd, as well as useless, if a general authority wasintended.\", \"in like manner the judicial authority of the federal judicatures isdeclared by the constitution to comprehend certain cases particularlyspecified. the expression of those cases marks the precise limits,beyond which the federal courts cannot extend their jurisdiction,because the objects of their cognizance being enumerated, thespecification would be nugatory if it did not exclude all ideas of moreextensive authority.\", \"these examples are sufficient to elucidate the maxims which have beenmentioned, and to designate the manner in which they should be used. butthat there may be no misapprehensions upon this subject, i shall add onecase more, to demonstrate the proper use of these maxims, and the abusewhich has been made of them.\"  …  \"but this is not all: if we advert to the observations already maderespecting the courts that subsist in the several states of the union,and the different powers exercised by them, it will appear that thereare no expressions more vague and indeterminate than those whichhave been employed to characterize that species of causes which itis intended shall be entitled to a trial by jury. in this state, theboundaries between actions at common law and actions of equitablejurisdiction, are ascertained in conformity to the rules which prevailin england upon that subject. in many of the other states the boundariesare less precise. in some of them every cause is to be tried in a courtof common law, and upon that foundation every action may be consideredas an action at common law, to be determined by a jury, if the parties,or either of them, choose it. hence the same irregularity and confusionwould be introduced by a compliance with this proposition, that ihave already noticed as resulting from the regulation proposed bythe pennsylvania minority. in one state a cause would receive itsdetermination from a jury, if the parties, or either of them, requestedit; but in another state, a cause exactly similar to the other, mustbe decided without the intervention of a jury, because the statejudicatories varied as to common-law jurisdiction.\", \"it is obvious, therefore, that the massachusetts proposition, upon thissubject cannot operate as a general regulation, until some uniform plan,with respect to the limits of common-law and equitable jurisdictions,shall be adopted by the different states. to devise a plan of that kindis a task arduous in itself, and which it would require much timeand reflection to mature. it would be extremely difficult, if notimpossible, to suggest any general regulation that would be acceptableto all the states in the union, or that would perfectly quadrate withthe several state institutions.\", \"it may be asked, why could not a reference have been made to theconstitution of this state, taking that, which is allowed by me to be agood one, as a standard for the united states? i answer that it is notvery probable the other states would entertain the same opinion of ourinstitutions as we do ourselves. it is natural to suppose that they arehitherto more attached to their own, and that each would struggle forthe preference. if the plan of taking one state as a model for the wholehad been thought of in the convention, it is to be presumed that theadoption of it in that body would have been rendered difficult by thepredilection of each representation in favor of its own government; andit must be uncertain which of the states would have been taken as themodel. it has been shown that many of them would be improper ones. andi leave it to conjecture, whether, under all circumstances, it is mostlikely that new york, or some other state, would have been preferred.but admit that a judicious selection could have been effected in theconvention, still there would have been great danger of jealousy anddisgust in the other states, at the partiality which had been shownto the institutions of one. the enemies of the plan would have beenfurnished with a fine pretext for raising a host of local prejudicesagainst it, which perhaps might have hazarded, in no inconsiderabledegree, its final establishment.\", \"to avoid the embarrassments of a definition of the cases which thetrial by jury ought to embrace, it is sometimes suggested by men ofenthusiastic tempers, that a provision might have been insertedfor establishing it in all cases whatsoever. for this i believe,no precedent is to be found in any member of the union; and theconsiderations which have been stated in discussing the proposition ofthe minority of pennsylvania, must satisfy every sober mind that theestablishment of the trial by jury in all cases would have been anunpardonable error in the plan.\", \"in short, the more it is considered the more arduous will appear thetask of fashioning a provision in such a form as not to express toolittle to answer the purpose, or too much to be advisable; or whichmight not have opened other sources of opposition to the great andessential object of introducing a firm national government.\", \"i cannot but persuade myself, on the other hand, that the differentlights in which the subject has been placed in the course of theseobservations, will go far towards removing in candid minds theapprehensions they may have entertained on the point. they have tendedto show that the security of liberty is materially concerned only in thetrial by jury in criminal cases, which is provided for in the most amplemanner in the plan of the convention; that even in far the greatestproportion of civil cases, and those in which the great body of thecommunity is interested, that mode of trial will remain in its fullforce, as established in the state constitutions, untouched andunaffected by the plan of the convention; that it is in nocase abolished by that plan; and that there are great if notinsurmountable difficulties in the way of making any precise and properprovision for it in a constitution for the united states.\", \"the best judges of the matter will be the least anxious for aconstitutional establishment of the trial by jury in civil cases, andwill be the most ready to admit that the changes which are continuallyhappening in the affairs of society may render a different mode ofdetermining questions of property preferable in many cases in whichthat mode of trial now prevails. for my part, i acknowledge myself to beconvinced that even in this state it might be advantageously extendedto some cases to which it does not at present apply, and might asadvantageously be abridged in others. it is conceded by all reasonablemen that it ought not to obtain in all cases. the examples ofinnovations which contract its ancient limits, as well in these statesas in great britain, afford a strong presumption that its former extenthas been found inconvenient, and give room to suppose that futureexperience may discover the propriety and utility of other exceptions.i suspect it to be impossible in the nature of the thing to fix thesalutary point at which the operation of the institution ought to stop,and this is with me a strong argument for leaving the matter to thediscretion of the legislature.\", \"this is now clearly understood to be the case in great britain, andit is equally so in the state of connecticut; and yet it may be safelyaffirmed that more numerous encroachments have been made upon the trialby jury in this state since the revolution, though provided for by apositive article of our constitution, than has happened in the sametime either in connecticut or great britain. it may be added that theseencroachments have generally originated with the men who endeavor topersuade the people they are the warmest defenders of popular liberty,but who have rarely suffered constitutional obstacles to arrest them ina favorite career. the truth is that the general genius of a governmentis all that can be substantially relied upon for permanent effects.particular provisions, though not altogether useless, have far lessvirtue and efficacy than are commonly ascribed to them; and the want ofthem will never be, with men of sound discernment, a decisive objectionto any plan which exhibits the leading characters of a good government.\", \"it certainly sounds not a little harsh and extraordinary to affirmthat there is no security for liberty in a constitution which expresslyestablishes the trial by jury in criminal cases, because it does not doit in civil also; while it is a notorious fact that connecticut, whichhas been always regarded as the most popular state in the union, canboast of no constitutional provision for either.\", \"publius\"]\n",

but as the subject has beendrawn into great length, i shall so far consult brevity as to compriseall my observations on these miscellaneous points in a single paper.\", \"the most considerable of the remaining objections is that the plan ofthe convention contains no bill of rights. among other answers givento this, it has been upon different occasions remarked that theconstitutions of several of the states are in a similar predicament.i add that new york is of the number. and yet the opposers of the newsystem, in this state, who profess an unlimited admiration for itsconstitution, are among the most intemperate partisans of a bill ofrights. to justify their zeal in this matter, they allege two things:one is that, though the constitution of new york has no bill of rightsprefixed to it, yet it contains, in the body of it, various provisionsin favor of particular privileges and rights, which, in substance amountto the same thing; the other is, that the constitution adopts, in theirfull extent, the common and statute law of great britain, by which manyother rights, not expressed in it, are equally secured.\", \"to the first i answer, that the constitution proposed by the conventioncontains, as well as the constitution of this state, a number of suchprovisions.\", \"independent of those which relate to the structure of the government, wefind the following: article 1, section 3, clause 7--\\\"judgment in casesof impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office, anddisqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profitunder the united states; but the party convicted shall, nevertheless,be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment, and punishmentaccording to law.\\\" section 9, of the same article, clause 2--\\\"theprivilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unlesswhen in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may requireit.\\\" clause 3--\\\"no bill of attainder or ex-post-facto law shall bepassed.\\\" clause 7--\\\"no title of nobility shall be granted by the unitedstates;

and suchtrial shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have beencommitted; but when not committed within any state, the trial shallbe at such place or places as the congress may by law have directed.\\\"section 3, of the same article--\\\"treason against the united statesshall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to theirenemies, giving them aid and comfort. no person shall be convicted oftreason, unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act,or on confession in open court.\\\" and clause 3, of the same section--\\\"thecongress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason; butno attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture,except during the life of the person attainted.\\\"\", \"it may well be a question, whether these are not, upon the whole, ofequal importance with any which are to be found in the constitutionof this state. the establishment of the writ of habeas corpus, theprohibition of ex post facto laws, and of titles of nobility, to whichwe have no corresponding provision in our constitution, are perhapsgreater securities to liberty and republicanism than any it contains.the creation of crimes after the commission of the fact, or, in otherwords, the subjecting of men to punishment for things which, whenthey were done, were breaches of no law, and the practice of arbitraryimprisonments, have been, in all ages, the favorite and most formidableinstruments of tyranny. the observations of the judicious blackstone,in reference to the latter, are well worthy of recital: \\\"to bereave aman of life, (says he) or by violence to confiscate his estate,without accusation or trial, would be so gross and notorious an act ofdespotism, as must at once convey the alarm of tyranny throughout thewhole nation; but confinement of the person, by secretly hurrying him tojail, where his sufferings are unknown or forgotten, is a less public,a less striking, and therefore a more dangerous engine of arbitrarygovernment.\\\" and as a remedy for this fatal evil he is everywherepeculiarly emphatical in his encomiums on the habeas corpus act, whichin one place he calls \\\"the bulwark of the british constitution.\\\"\", \"nothing need be said to illustrate the importance of the prohibition oftitles of nobility. this may truly be denominated the corner-stone ofrepublican government; for so long as they are excluded, there can neverbe serious danger that the government will be any other than that of thepeople.\", \"to the second that is, to the pretended establishment of the common andstate law by the constitution, i answer, that they are expressly madesubject \\\"to such alterations and provisions as the legislature shallfrom time to time make concerning the same.\\\" they are therefore at anymoment liable to repeal by the ordinary legislative power, and of coursehave no constitutional sanction. the only use of the declaration wasto recognize the ancient law and to remove doubts which might have beenoccasioned by the revolution. this consequently can be considered as nopart of a declaration of rights, which under our constitutions must beintended as limitations of the power of the government itself.\", \"it has been several times truly remarked that bills of rights are,in their origin, stipulations between kings and their subjects,abridgements of prerogative in favor of privilege, reservations ofrights not surrendered to the prince. such was magna charta, obtainedby the barons, sword in hand, from king john. such were the subsequentconfirmations of that charter by succeeding princes. such was thepetition of right assented to by charles i., in the beginning of hisreign. such, also, was the declaration of right presented by the lordsand commons to the prince of orange in 1688, and afterwards throwninto the form of an act of parliament called the bill of rights. it isevident, therefore, that, according to their primitive signification,they have no application to constitutions professedly founded upon thepower of the people, and executed by their immediate representatives andservants. here, in strictness, the people surrender nothing; and as theyretain every thing they have no need of particular reservations. \\\"we,the people of the united states, to secure the blessings of liberty toourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitutionfor the united states of america.\\\" here is a better recognition ofpopular rights, than volumes of those aphorisms which make the principalfigure in several of our state bills of rights, and which wouldsound much better in a treatise of ethics than in a constitution ofgovernment.\", \"but a minute detail of particular rights is certainly far lessapplicable to a constitution like that under consideration, which ismerely intended to regulate the general political interests of thenation, than to a constitution which has the regulation of every speciesof personal and private concerns. if, therefore, the loud clamorsagainst the plan of the convention, on this score, are well founded, noepithets of reprobation will be too strong for the constitution ofthis state. but the truth is, that both of them contain all which, inrelation to their objects, is reasonably to be desired.\"  …  \"among the many curious objections which have appeared against theproposed constitution, the most extraordinary and the least colorable isderived from the want of some provision respecting the debts due to theunited states. this has been represented as a tacit relinquishment ofthose debts, and as a wicked contrivance to screen public defaulters.the newspapers have teemed with the most inflammatory railings on thishead; yet there is nothing clearer than that the suggestion is entirelyvoid of foundation, the offspring of extreme ignorance or extremedishonesty. in addition to the remarks i have made upon the subject inanother place, i shall only observe that as it is a plain dictate ofcommon-sense, so it is also an established doctrine of political law,that \\\"states neither lose any of their rights, nor are dischargedfrom any of their obligations, by a change in the form of their civilgovernment.\\\"\", \"the last objection of any consequence, which i at present recollect,turns upon the article of expense. if it were even true, that theadoption of the proposed government would occasion a considerableincrease of expense, it would be an objection that ought to have noweight against the plan.\", \"the great bulk of the citizens of america are with reason convinced,that union is the basis of their political happiness. men of sense ofall parties now, with few exceptions, agree that it cannot be preservedunder the present system, nor without radical alterations; that newand extensive powers ought to be granted to the national head, and thatthese require a different organization of the federal government--asingle body being an unsafe depositary of such ample authorities. inconceding all this, the question of expense must be given up; for itis impossible, with any degree of safety, to narrow the foundation uponwhich the system is to stand. the two branches of the legislature are,in the first instance, to consist of only sixty-five persons, which isthe same number of which congress, under the existing confederation, maybe composed. it is true that this number is intended to be increased;but this is to keep pace with the progress of the population andresources of the country. it is evident that a less number would, evenin the first instance, have been unsafe, and that a continuance of thepresent number would, in a more advanced stage of population, be a veryinadequate representation of the people.\", \"whence is the dreaded augmentation of expense to spring? one sourceindicated, is the multiplication of offices under the new government.let us examine this a little.\", \"it is evident that the principal departments of the administration underthe present government, are the same which will be required under thenew. there are now a secretary of war, a secretary of foreign affairs, asecretary for domestic affairs, a board of treasury, consisting ofthree persons, a treasurer, assistants, clerks, etc. these officers areindispensable under any system, and will suffice under the new as wellas the old. as to ambassadors and other ministers and agents in foreigncountries, the proposed constitution can make no other difference thanto render their characters, where they reside, more respectable,and their services more useful. as to persons to be employed in thecollection of the revenues, it is unquestionably true that these willform a very considerable addition to the number of federal officers;but it will not follow that this will occasion an increase of publicexpense. it will be in most cases nothing more than an exchange of statefor national officers. in the collection of all duties, for instance,the persons employed will be wholly of the latter description. thestates individually will stand in no need of any for this purpose.what difference can it make in point of expense to pay officers of thecustoms appointed by the state or by the united states? there is no goodreason to suppose that either the number or the salaries of the latterwill be greater than those of the former.\", \"where then are we to seek for those additional articles of expense whichare to swell the account to the enormous size that has been representedto us? the chief item which occurs to me respects the support of thejudges of the united states. i do not add the president, because thereis now a president of congress, whose expenses may not be far, if anything, short of those which will be incurred on account of the presidentof the united states. the support of the judges will clearly be an extraexpense, but to what extent will depend on the particular plan which maybe adopted in regard to this matter. but upon no reasonable plan can itamount to a sum which will be an object of material consequence.\", \"let us now see what there is to counterbalance any extra expense thatmay attend the establishment of the proposed government. the first thingwhich presents itself is that a great part of the business which nowkeeps congress sitting through the year will be transacted by thepresident. even the management of foreign negotiations will naturallydevolve upon him, according to general principles concerted with thesenate, and subject to their final concurrence. hence it is evident thata portion of the year will suffice for the session of both the senateand the house of representatives; we may suppose about a fourth for thelatter and a third, or perhaps half, for the former. the extra businessof treaties and appointments may give this extra occupation to thesenate. from this circumstance we may infer that, until the house ofrepresentatives shall be increased greatly beyond its present number,there will be a considerable saving of expense from the differencebetween the constant session of the present and the temporary session ofthe future congress.\", \"but there is another circumstance of great importance in the view ofeconomy. the business of the united states has hitherto occupiedthe state legislatures, as well as congress. the latter has maderequisitions which the former have had to provide for. hence ithas happened that the sessions of the state legislatures have beenprotracted greatly beyond what was necessary for the execution of themere local business of the states. more than half their time has beenfrequently employed in matters which related to the united states. nowthe members who compose the legislatures of the several states amount totwo thousand and upwards, which number has hitherto performed what underthe new system will be done in the first instance by sixty-five persons,and probably at no future period by above a fourth or fifth of thatnumber. the congress under the proposed government will do all thebusiness of the united states themselves, without the intervention ofthe state legislatures, who thenceforth will have only to attend tothe affairs of their particular states, and will not have to sit in anyproportion as long as they have heretofore done. this difference in thetime of the sessions of the state legislatures will be clear gain,and will alone form an article of saving, which may be regarded as anequivalent for any additional objects of expense that may be occasionedby the adoption of the new system.\", \"the result from these observations is that the sources of additionalexpense from the establishment of the proposed constitution are muchfewer than may have been imagined; that they are counterbalanced byconsiderable objects of saving; and that while it is questionable onwhich side the scale will preponderate, it is certain that a governmentless expensive would be incompetent to the purposes of the union.\", \"publius\"]\n",

and hence, also, an immense multiplication of difficulties andcasualties in obtaining the collective assent to a final act. the degreeof that multiplication must evidently be in a ratio to the number ofparticulars and the number of parties.\", \"but every amendment to the constitution, if once established, would bea single proposition, and might be brought forward singly. there wouldthen be no necessity for management or compromise, in relation to anyother point--no giving nor taking. the will of the requisite numberwould at once bring the matter to a decisive issue. and consequently,whenever nine, or rather ten states, were united in the desire of aparticular amendment, that amendment must infallibly take place. therecan, therefore, be no comparison between the facility of affecting anamendment, and that of establishing in the first instance a completeconstitution.\", \"in opposition to the probability of subsequent amendments, it has beenurged that the persons delegated to the administration of the nationalgovernment will always be disinclined to yield up any portion ofthe authority of which they were once possessed. for my own part iacknowledge a thorough conviction that any amendments which may, uponmature consideration, be thought useful, will be applicable to theorganization of the government, not to the mass of its powers; and onthis account alone, i think there is no weight in the observation juststated. i also think there is little weight in it on another account.the intrinsic difficulty of governing thirteen states at any rate,independent of calculations upon an ordinary degree of public spirit andintegrity, will, in my opinion constantly impose on the nationalrulers the necessity of a spirit of accommodation to the reasonableexpectations of their constituents. but there is yet a furtherconsideration, which proves beyond the possibility of a doubt, that theobservation is futile. it is this that the national rulers, whenevernine states concur, will have no option upon the subject. by the fiftharticle of the plan, the congress will be obliged \\\"on the application ofthe legislatures of two thirds of the states (which at present amountto nine), to call a convention for proposing amendments, which shall bevalid, to all intents and purposes, as part of the constitution, whenratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the states, or byconventions in three fourths thereof.\\\" the words of this article areperemptory. the congress \\\"shall call a convention.\\\" nothing in thisparticular is left to the discretion of that body. and of consequence,all the declamation about the disinclination to a change vanishes inair. nor however difficult it may be supposed to unite two thirds orthree fourths of the state legislatures, in amendments which may affectlocal interests, can there be any room to apprehend any such difficultyin a union on points which are merely relative to the general libertyor security of the people. we may safely rely on the disposition of thestate legislatures to erect barriers against the encroachments of thenational authority.\", \"if the foregoing argument is a fallacy, certain it is that i am myselfdeceived by it, for it is, in my conception, one of those rare instancesin which a political truth can be brought to the test of a mathematicaldemonstration. those who see the matter in the same light with me,however zealous they may be for amendments, must agree in the proprietyof a previous adoption, as the most direct road to their own object.\", \"the zeal for attempts to amend, prior to the establishment of theconstitution, must abate in every man who is ready to accede to thetruth of the following observations of a writer equally solid andingenious: \\\"to balance a large state or society (says he), whethermonarchical or republican, on general laws, is a work of so greatdifficulty, that no human genius, however comprehensive, is able, by themere dint of reason and reflection, to effect it. the judgments of manymust unite in the work; experience must guide their labor; time mustbring it to perfection, and the feeling of inconveniences must correctthe mistakes which they inevitably fall into in their first trialsand experiments.\\\" these judicious reflections contain a lesson ofmoderation to all the sincere lovers of the union, and ought to putthem upon their guard against hazarding anarchy, civil war, a perpetualalienation of the states from each other, and perhaps the militarydespotism of a victorious demagogue, in the pursuit of what they are notlikely to obtain, but from time and experience. it may be in me a defectof political fortitude, but i acknowledge that i cannot entertain anequal tranquillity with those who affect to treat the dangers of alonger continuance in our present situation as imaginary. a nation,without a national government, is, in my view, an awful spectacle.the establishment of a constitution, in time of profound peace, by thevoluntary consent of a whole people, is a prodigy, to the completion ofwhich i look forward with trembling anxiety. i can reconcile it tono rules of prudence to let go the hold we now have, in so arduous anenterprise, upon seven out of the thirteen states, and after havingpassed over so considerable a part of the ground, to recommence thecourse. i dread the more the consequences of new attempts, because iknow that powerful individuals, in this and in other states, are enemiesto a general national government in every possible shape.\", \"publius\"]"
