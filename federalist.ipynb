      "\r\n",
      "To the People of the State of New York:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "AFTER an unequivocal experience of the inefficacy of the subsisting\r\n",
      "federal government, you are called upon to deliberate on a new\r\n",
      "Constitution for the United States of America. The subject speaks its\r\n",
      "own importance; comprehending in its consequences nothing less than the\r\n",
      "existence of the UNION, the safety and welfare of the parts of which it\r\n",
      "is composed, the fate of an empire in many respects the most interesting\r\n",
      "in the world. It has been frequently remarked that it seems to have been\r\n",
      "reserved to the people of this country, by their conduct and example,\r\n",
      "to decide the important question, whether societies of men are really\r\n",
      "capable or not of establishing good government from reflection and\r\n",
      "choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend for their\r\n",
      "political constitutions on accident and force. If there be any truth\r\n",
      "in the remark, the crisis at which we are arrived may with propriety be\r\n",
      "regarded as the era in which that decision is to be made; and a wrong\r\n",
      "election of the part we shall act may, in this view, deserve to be\r\n",
      "considered as the general misfortune of mankind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This idea will add the inducements of philanthropy to those of\r\n",
      "patriotism, to heighten the solicitude which all considerate and good\r\n",
      "men must feel for the event. Happy will it be if our choice should be\r\n",
      "directed by a judicious estimate of our true interests, unperplexed and\r\n",
      "unbiased by considerations not connected with the public good. But this\r\n",
      "is a thing more ardently to be wished than seriously to be expected. The\r\n",
      "plan offered to our deliberations affects too many particular interests,\r\n",
      "innovates upon too many local institutions, not to involve in its\r\n",
      "discussion a variety of objects foreign to its merits, and of views,\r\n",
      "passions and prejudices little favorable to the discovery of truth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Among the most formidable of the obstacles which the new Constitution\r\n",
      "will have to encounter may readily be distinguished the obvious interest\r\n",
      "of a certain class of men in every State to resist all changes which\r\n",
      "may hazard a diminution of the power, emolument, and consequence of\r\n",
      "the offices they hold under the State establishments; and the perverted\r\n",
      "ambition of another class of men, who will either hope to aggrandize\r\n",
      "themselves by the confusions of their country, or will flatter\r\n",
      "themselves with fairer prospects of elevation from the subdivision of\r\n",
      "the empire into several partial confederacies than from its union under\r\n",
      "one government.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is not, however, my design to dwell upon observations of this\r\n",
      "nature. I am well aware that it would be disingenuous to resolve\r\n",
      "indiscriminately the opposition of any set of men (merely because their\r\n",
      "situations might subject them to suspicion) into interested or ambitious\r\n",
      "views. Candor will oblige us to admit that even such men may be actuated\r\n",
      "by upright intentions; and it cannot be doubted that much of the\r\n",
      "opposition which has made its appearance, or may hereafter make its\r\n",
      "appearance, will spring from sources, blameless at least, if not\r\n",
      "respectable--the honest errors of minds led astray by preconceived\r\n",
      "jealousies and fears. So numerous indeed and so powerful are the causes\r\n",
      "which serve to give a false bias to the judgment, that we, upon many\r\n",
      "occasions, see wise and good men on the wrong as well as on the right\r\n",
      "side of questions of the first magnitude to society. This circumstance,\r\n",
      "if duly attended to, would furnish a lesson of moderation to those\r\n",
      "who are ever so much persuaded of their being in the right in any\r\n",
      "controversy. And a further reason for caution, in this respect, might\r\n",
      "be drawn from the reflection that we are not always sure that those\r\n",
      "who advocate the truth are influenced by purer principles than their\r\n",
      "antagonists. Ambition, avarice, personal animosity, party opposition,\r\n",
      "and many other motives not more laudable than these, are apt to operate\r\n",
      "as well upon those who support as those who oppose the right side of a\r\n",
      "question. Were there not even these inducements to moderation, nothing\r\n",
      "could be more ill-judged than that intolerant spirit which has, at all\r\n",
      "times, characterized political parties. For in politics, as in religion,\r\n",
      "it is equally absurd to aim at making proselytes by fire and sword.\r\n",
      "Heresies in either can rarely be cured by persecution.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And yet, however just these sentiments will be allowed to be, we have\r\n",
      "already sufficient indications that it will happen in this as in all\r\n",
      "former cases of great national discussion. A torrent of angry and\r\n",
      "malignant passions will be let loose. To judge from the conduct of the\r\n",
      "opposite parties, we shall be led to conclude that they will mutually\r\n",
      "hope to evince the justness of their opinions, and to increase the\r\n",
      "number of their converts by the loudness of their declamations and the\r\n",
      "bitterness of their invectives. An enlightened zeal for the energy\r\n",
      "and efficiency of government will be stigmatized as the offspring of a\r\n",
      "temper fond of despotic power and hostile to the principles of liberty.\r\n",
      "An over-scrupulous jealousy of danger to the rights of the people,\r\n",
      "which is more commonly the fault of the head than of the heart, will be\r\n",
      "represented as mere pretense and artifice, the stale bait for popularity\r\n",
      "at the expense of the public good. It will be forgotten, on the one\r\n",
      "hand, that jealousy is the usual concomitant of love, and that the noble\r\n",
      "enthusiasm of liberty is apt to be infected with a spirit of narrow and\r\n",
      "illiberal distrust. On the other hand, it will be equally forgotten that\r\n",
      "the vigor of government is essential to the security of liberty; that,\r\n",
      "in the contemplation of a sound and well-informed judgment, their\r\n",
      "interest can never be separated; and that a dangerous ambition more\r\n",
      "often lurks behind the specious mask of zeal for the rights of the\r\n",
      "people than under the forbidden appearance of zeal for the firmness and\r\n",
      "efficiency of government. History will teach us that the former has been\r\n",
      "found a much more certain road to the introduction of despotism than\r\n",
      "the latter, and that of those men who have overturned the liberties\r\n",
      "of republics, the greatest number have begun their career by paying\r\n",
      "an obsequious court to the people; commencing demagogues, and ending\r\n",
      "tyrants.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the course of the preceding observations, I have had an eye, my\r\n",
      "fellow-citizens, to putting you upon your guard against all attempts,\r\n",
      "from whatever quarter, to influence your decision in a matter of the\r\n",
      "utmost moment to your welfare, by any impressions other than those which\r\n",
      "may result from the evidence of truth. You will, no doubt, at the same\r\n",
      "time, have collected from the general scope of them, that they\r\n",
      "proceed from a source not unfriendly to the new Constitution. Yes,\r\n",
      "my countrymen, I own to you that, after having given it an attentive\r\n",
      "consideration, I am clearly of opinion it is your interest to adopt it.\r\n",
      "I am convinced that this is the safest course for your liberty, your\r\n",
      "dignity, and your happiness. I affect not reserves which I do not feel.\r\n",
      "I will not amuse you with an appearance of deliberation when I have\r\n",
      "decided. I frankly acknowledge to you my convictions, and I will freely\r\n",
      "lay before you the reasons on which they are founded. The consciousness\r\n",
      "of good intentions disdains ambiguity. I shall not, however, multiply\r\n",
      "professions on this head. My motives must remain in the depository of\r\n",
      "my own breast. My arguments will be open to all, and may be judged of by\r\n",
      "all. They shall at least be offered in a spirit which will not disgrace\r\n",
      "the cause of truth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I propose, in a series of papers, to discuss the following interesting\r\n",
      "particulars:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "THE UTILITY OF THE UNION TO YOUR POLITICAL PROSPERITY THE INSUFFICIENCY\r\n",
      "OF THE PRESENT CONFEDERATION TO PRESERVE THAT UNION THE NECESSITY OF\r\n",
      "A GOVERNMENT AT LEAST EQUALLY ENERGETIC WITH THE ONE PROPOSED, TO THE\r\n",
      "ATTAINMENT OF THIS OBJECT THE CONFORMITY OF THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTION\r\n",
      "TO THE TRUE PRINCIPLES OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT ITS ANALOGY TO YOUR\r\n",
      "OWN STATE CONSTITUTION and lastly, THE ADDITIONAL SECURITY WHICH ITS\r\n",
      "ADOPTION WILL AFFORD TO THE PRESERVATION OF THAT SPECIES OF GOVERNMENT,\r\n",
      "TO LIBERTY, AND TO PROPERTY.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the progress of this discussion I shall endeavor to give a\r\n",
      "satisfactory answer to all the objections which shall have made their\r\n",
      "appearance, that may seem to have any claim to your attention.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It may perhaps be thought superfluous to offer arguments to prove the\r\n",
      "utility of the UNION, a point, no doubt, deeply engraved on the hearts\r\n",
      "of the great body of the people in every State, and one, which it may be\r\n",
      "imagined, has no adversaries. But the fact is, that we already hear\r\n",
      "it whispered in the private circles of those who oppose the new\r\n",
      "Constitution, that the thirteen States are of too great extent for\r\n",
      "any general system, and that we must of necessity resort to separate\r\n",
      "confederacies of distinct portions of the whole.(1) This doctrine will,\r\n",
      "in all probability, be gradually propagated, till it has votaries enough\r\n",
      "to countenance an open avowal of it. For nothing can be more evident,\r\n",
      "to those who are able to take an enlarged view of the subject, than the\r\n",
      "alternative of an adoption of the new Constitution or a dismemberment\r\n",
      "of the Union. It will therefore be of use to begin by examining the\r\n",
      "advantages of that Union, the certain evils, and the probable dangers,\r\n",
      "to which every State will be exposed from its dissolution. This shall\r\n",
      "accordingly constitute the subject of my next address.\r\n",

      "WHEN the people of America reflect that they are now called upon to\r\n",
      "decide a question, which, in its consequences, must prove one of the\r\n",
      "most important that ever engaged their attention, the propriety of their\r\n",
      "taking a very comprehensive, as well as a very serious, view of it, will\r\n",

      "Nothing is more certain than the indispensable necessity of government,\r\n",

      "in order to vest it with requisite powers. It is well worthy of\r\n",

      "of the people of America that they should, to all general purposes, be\r\n",
      "one nation, under one federal government, or that they should divide\r\n",
      "themselves into separate confederacies, and give to the head of each\r\n",
      "the same kind of powers which they are advised to place in one national\r\n",
      "government.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It has until lately been a received and uncontradicted opinion that the\r\n",
      "prosperity of the people of America depended on their continuing firmly\r\n",
      "united, and the wishes, prayers, and efforts of our best and wisest\r\n",
      "citizens have been constantly directed to that object. But politicians\r\n",
      "now appear, who insist that this opinion is erroneous, and that instead\r\n",
      "of looking for safety and happiness in union, we ought to seek it in\r\n",
      "a division of the States into distinct confederacies or sovereignties.\r\n",
      "However extraordinary this new doctrine may appear, it nevertheless\r\n",
      "has its advocates; and certain characters who were much opposed to it\r\n",
      "formerly, are at present of the number. Whatever may be the arguments\r\n",
      "or inducements which have wrought this change in the sentiments and\r\n",
      "declarations of these gentlemen, it certainly would not be wise in the\r\n",
      "people at large to adopt these new political tenets without being fully\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It has often given me pleasure to observe that independent America\r\n",
      "was not composed of detached and distant territories, but that one\r\n",
      "connected, fertile, wide-spreading country was the portion of our western\r\n",
      "sons of liberty. Providence has in a particular manner blessed it with\r\n",
      "a variety of soils and productions, and watered it with innumerable\r\n",
      "streams, for the delight and accommodation of its inhabitants. A\r\n",
      "succession of navigable waters forms a kind of chain round its borders,\r\n",
      "as if to bind it together; while the most noble rivers in the world,\r\n",
      "running at convenient distances, present them with highways for the\r\n",
      "easy communication of friendly aids, and the mutual transportation and\r\n",
      "exchange of their various commodities.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With equal pleasure I have as often taken notice that Providence has\r\n",
      "been pleased to give this one connected country to one united people--a\r\n",
      "people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language,\r\n",
      "professing the same religion, attached to the same principles of\r\n",
      "government, very similar in their manners and customs, and who, by their\r\n",
      "joint counsels, arms, and efforts, fighting side by side throughout\r\n",
      "a long and bloody war, have nobly established general liberty and\r\n",
      "independence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This country and this people seem to have been made for each other, and\r\n",

      "so proper and convenient for a band of brethren, united to each other\r\n",
      "by the strongest ties, should never be split into a number of unsocial,\r\n",
      "jealous, and alien sovereignties.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Similar sentiments have hitherto prevailed among all orders and\r\n",
      "denominations of men among us. To all general purposes we have uniformly\r\n",
      "been one people each individual citizen everywhere enjoying the same\r\n",
      "national rights, privileges, and protection. As a nation we have made\r\n",
      "peace and war; as a nation we have vanquished our common enemies; as\r\n",

      "various compacts and conventions with foreign states.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A strong sense of the value and blessings of union induced the people,\r\n",
      "at a very early period, to institute a federal government to preserve\r\n",
      "and perpetuate it. They formed it almost as soon as they had a political\r\n",
      "existence; nay, at a time when their habitations were in flames, when\r\n",
      "many of their citizens were bleeding, and when the progress of hostility\r\n",
      "and desolation left little room for those calm and mature inquiries\r\n",
      "and reflections which must ever precede the formation of a wise and\r\n",
      "well-balanced government for a free people. It is not to be wondered\r\n",
      "at, that a government instituted in times so inauspicious, should on\r\n",

      "was intended to answer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This intelligent people perceived and regretted these defects. Still\r\n",
      "continuing no less attached to union than enamored of liberty, they\r\n",
      "observed the danger which immediately threatened the former and more\r\n",
      "remotely the latter; and being persuaded that ample security for both\r\n",
      "could only be found in a national government more wisely framed, they\r\n",
      "as with one voice, convened the late convention at Philadelphia, to take\r\n",
      "that important subject under consideration.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This convention composed of men who possessed the confidence of the\r\n",
      "people, and many of whom had become highly distinguished by their\r\n",
      "patriotism, virtue and wisdom, in times which tried the minds and hearts\r\n",
      "of men, undertook the arduous task. In the mild season of peace, with\r\n",
      "minds unoccupied by other subjects, they passed many months in cool,\r\n",
      "uninterrupted, and daily consultation; and finally, without having\r\n",
      "been awed by power, or influenced by any passions except love for their\r\n",
      "country, they presented and recommended to the people the plan produced\r\n",
      "by their joint and very unanimous councils.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Admit, for so is the fact, that this plan is only RECOMMENDED, not\r\n",
      "imposed, yet let it be remembered that it is neither recommended to\r\n",
      "BLIND approbation, nor to BLIND reprobation; but to that sedate and\r\n",
      "candid consideration which the magnitude and importance of the subject\r\n",
      "demand, and which it certainly ought to receive. But this (as was\r\n",
      "remarked in the foregoing number of this paper) is more to be wished\r\n",
      "than expected, that it may be so considered and examined. Experience on\r\n",
      "a former occasion teaches us not to be too sanguine in such hopes. It\r\n",
      "is not yet forgotten that well-grounded apprehensions of imminent danger\r\n",
      "induced the people of America to form the memorable Congress of 1774.\r\n",
      "That body recommended certain measures to their constituents, and the\r\n",
      "event proved their wisdom; yet it is fresh in our memories how soon the\r\n",
      "press began to teem with pamphlets and weekly papers against those very\r\n",
      "measures. Not only many of the officers of government, who obeyed the\r\n",
      "dictates of personal interest, but others, from a mistaken estimate of\r\n",
      "consequences, or the undue influence of former attachments, or whose\r\n",
      "ambition aimed at objects which did not correspond with the public good,\r\n",
      "were indefatigable in their efforts to persuade the people to reject\r\n",
      "the advice of that patriotic Congress. Many, indeed, were deceived\r\n",
      "and deluded, but the great majority of the people reasoned and decided\r\n",
      "judiciously; and happy they are in reflecting that they did so.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They considered that the Congress was composed of many wise and\r\n",
      "experienced men. That, being convened from different parts of the\r\n",
      "country, they brought with them and communicated to each other a variety\r\n",
      "of useful information. That, in the course of the time they passed\r\n",
      "together in inquiring into and discussing the true interests of their\r\n",
      "country, they must have acquired very accurate knowledge on that\r\n",
      "head. That they were individually interested in the public liberty and\r\n",
      "prosperity, and therefore that it was not less their inclination than\r\n",
      "their duty to recommend only such measures as, after the most mature\r\n",
      "deliberation, they really thought prudent and advisable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These and similar considerations then induced the people to rely greatly\r\n",
      "on the judgment and integrity of the Congress; and they took their\r\n",
      "advice, notwithstanding the various arts and endeavors used to deter\r\n",
      "them from it. But if the people at large had reason to confide in the\r\n",
      "men of that Congress, few of whom had been fully tried or generally\r\n",
      "known, still greater reason have they now to respect the judgment and\r\n",
      "advice of the convention, for it is well known that some of the most\r\n",
      "distinguished members of that Congress, who have been since tried and\r\n",
      "justly approved for patriotism and abilities, and who have grown old in\r\n",
      "acquiring political information, were also members of this convention,\r\n",
      "and carried into it their accumulated knowledge and experience.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is worthy of remark that not only the first, but every succeeding\r\n",
      "Congress, as well as the late convention, have invariably joined with\r\n",
      "the people in thinking that the prosperity of America depended on its\r\n",
      "Union. To preserve and perpetuate it was the great object of the people\r\n",
      "in forming that convention, and it is also the great object of the plan\r\n",
      "which the convention has advised them to adopt. With what propriety,\r\n",
      "therefore, or for what good purposes, are attempts at this particular\r\n",
      "period made by some men to depreciate the importance of the Union? Or\r\n",
      "why is it suggested that three or four confederacies would be better\r\n",
      "than one? I am persuaded in my own mind that the people have always\r\n",
      "thought right on this subject, and that their universal and uniform\r\n",
      "attachment to the cause of the Union rests on great and weighty reasons,\r\n",
      "which I shall endeavor to develop and explain in some ensuing papers.\r\n",
      "They who promote the idea of substituting a number of distinct\r\n",
      "confederacies in the room of the plan of the convention, seem clearly to\r\n",
      "foresee that the rejection of it would put the continuance of the\r\n",
      "Union in the utmost jeopardy. That certainly would be the case, and I\r\n",
      "sincerely wish that it may be as clearly foreseen by every good citizen,\r\n",

      "preservation of peace and tranquillity, as well as against dangers from\r\n",
      "FOREIGN ARMS AND INFLUENCE, as from dangers of the LIKE KIND arising\r\n",
      "from domestic causes. As the former of these comes first in order, it\r\n",
      "is proper it should be the first discussed. Let us therefore proceed to\r\n",
      "examine whether the people are not right in their opinion that a cordial\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The JUST causes of war, for the most part, arise either from violation\r\n",

      "justice; but those temptations, not reaching the other States, and\r\n",
      "consequently having little or no influence on the national government,\r\n",
      "the temptation will be fruitless, and good faith and justice be\r\n",
      "preserved. The case of the treaty of peace with Britain adds great\r\n",

      "number of the inhabitants, the governing party may not always be\r\n",
      "able, if willing, to prevent the injustice meditated, or to punish the\r\n",
      "aggressors. But the national government, not being affected by those\r\n",

      "less to be apprehended under one general government than under several\r\n",
      "lesser ones, and in that respect the former most favors the SAFETY of\r\n",
      "the people.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As to those just causes of war which proceed from direct and unlawful\r\n",

      "apparent interest or injury, will be most likely, by direct violence,\r\n",

      "forming between England and Scotland, which merit our attention. I shall\r\n",
      "present the public with one or two extracts from it: \"An entire and\r\n",
      "perfect union will be the solid foundation of lasting peace: It will\r\n",
      "secure your religion, liberty, and property; remove the animosities\r\n",
      "amongst yourselves, and the jealousies and differences betwixt our two\r\n",
      "kingdoms. It must increase your strength, riches, and trade; and by\r\n",
      "this union the whole island, being joined in affection and free from all\r\n",
      "apprehensions of different interest, will be ENABLED TO RESIST ALL ITS\r\n",
      "ENEMIES.\" \"We most earnestly recommend to you calmness and unanimity in\r\n",
      "this great and weighty affair, that the union may be brought to a happy\r\n",

      "It was remarked in the preceding paper, that weakness and divisions at\r\n",
      "home would invite dangers from abroad; and that nothing would tend more\r\n",
      "to secure us from them than union, strength, and good government within\r\n",

      "their experience without paying the price which it cost them. Although\r\n",
      "it seems obvious to common sense that the people of such an island\r\n",
      "should be but one nation, yet we find that they were for ages divided\r\n",
      "into three, and that those three were almost constantly embroiled in\r\n",
      "quarrels and wars with one another. Notwithstanding their true interest\r\n",
      "with respect to the continental nations was really the same, yet by the\r\n",
      "arts and policy and practices of those nations, their mutual jealousies\r\n",

      "in affection\" and free from all apprehension of different \"interests,\"\r\n",
      "envy and jealousy would soon extinguish confidence and affection,\r\n",
      "and the partial interests of each confederacy, instead of the general\r\n",
      "interests of all America, would be the only objects of their policy and\r\n",
      "pursuits. Hence, like most other BORDERING nations, they would always\r\n",

      "reasonably suppose that they would long remain exactly on an equal\r\n",
      "footing in point of strength, even if it was possible to form them so at\r\n",
      "first; but, admitting that to be practicable, yet what human contrivance\r\n",
      "can secure the continuance of such equality? Independent of those local\r\n",
      "circumstances which tend to beget and increase power in one part and to\r\n",
      "impede its progress in another, we must advert to the effects of that\r\n",
      "superior policy and good management which would probably distinguish the\r\n",
      "government of one above the rest, and by which their relative equality\r\n",
      "in strength and consideration would be destroyed. For it cannot be\r\n",
      "presumed that the same degree of sound policy, prudence, and foresight\r\n",

      "that moment would those neighbors behold her with envy and with fear.\r\n",
      "Both those passions would lead them to countenance, if not to promote,\r\n",
      "whatever might promise to diminish her importance; and would also\r\n",
      "restrain them from measures calculated to advance or even to secure her\r\n",
      "prosperity. Much time would not be necessary to enable her to discern\r\n",
      "these unfriendly dispositions. She would soon begin, not only to lose\r\n",
      "confidence in her neighbors, but also to feel a disposition equally\r\n",
      "unfavorable to them. Distrust naturally creates distrust, and by nothing\r\n",

      "When did the independent states, into which Britain and Spain were\r\n",
      "formerly divided, combine in such alliance, or unite their forces\r\n",
      "against a foreign enemy? The proposed confederacies will be DISTINCT\r\n",
      "NATIONS. Each of them would have its commerce with foreigners to\r\n",
      "regulate by distinct treaties; and as their productions and commodities\r\n",
      "are different and proper for different markets, so would those treaties\r\n",
      "be essentially different. Different commercial concerns must create\r\n",
      "different interests, and of course different degrees of political\r\n",
      "attachment to and connection with different foreign nations. Hence it\r\n",
      "might and probably would happen that the foreign nation with whom the\r\n",
      "SOUTHERN confederacy might be at war would be the one with whom the\r\n",
      "NORTHERN confederacy would be the most desirous of preserving peace and\r\n",

      "our distance from Europe, it would be more natural for these\r\n",

      "guard against the others by the aid of foreign alliances, than to guard\r\n",

      "not forget how much more easy it is to receive foreign fleets into our\r\n",

      "enumeration of the dangers to which we should be exposed, in a state of\r\n",
      "disunion, from the arms and arts of foreign nations. I shall now proceed\r\n",
      "to delineate dangers of a different and, perhaps, still more alarming\r\n",
      "kind--those which will in all probability flow from dissensions between\r\n",
      "the States themselves, and from domestic factions and convulsions.\r\n",
      "These have been already in some instances slightly anticipated; but they\r\n",

      "thrown would have frequent and violent contests with each other. To\r\n",
      "presume a want of motives for such contests as an argument against their\r\n",
      "existence, would be to forget that men are ambitious, vindictive, and\r\n",
      "rapacious. To look for a continuation of harmony between a number of\r\n",
      "independent, unconnected sovereignties in the same neighborhood, would\r\n",

      "desire of equality and safety. There are others which have a more\r\n",

      "spheres. Such are the rivalships and competitions of commerce between\r\n",
      "commercial nations. And there are others, not less numerous than either\r\n",
      "of the former, which take their origin entirely in private passions;\r\n",

      "inhabitants of the two other States in the capacity of consumers of what\r\n",

      "it be practicable, if there were not this impediment in the way, to\r\n",
      "distinguish the customers in our own markets. Would Connecticut and New\r\n",
      "Jersey long submit to be taxed by New York for her exclusive benefit?\r\n",
      "Should we be long permitted to remain in the quiet and undisturbed\r\n",
      "enjoyment of a metropolis, from the possession of which we derived\r\n",

      "weight of Connecticut on the one side, and the co-operating pressure of\r\n",
      "New Jersey on the other? These are questions that temerity alone will\r\n",
      "answer in the affirmative.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The public debt of the Union would be a further cause of collision\r\n",
      "between the separate States or confederacies. The apportionment, in the\r\n",
      "first instance, and the progressive extinguishment afterward, would be\r\n",
      "alike productive of ill-humor and animosity. How would it be possible\r\n",
      "to agree upon a rule of apportionment satisfactory to all? There is\r\n",
      "scarcely any that can be proposed which is entirely free from real\r\n",
      "objections. These, as usual, would be exaggerated by the adverse\r\n",
      "interest of the parties. There are even dissimilar views among the\r\n",
      "States as to the general principle of discharging the public debt. Some\r\n",
      "of them, either less impressed with the importance of national credit,\r\n",
      "or because their citizens have little, if any, immediate interest in the\r\n",
      "question, feel an indifference, if not a repugnance, to the payment of\r\n",
      "the domestic debt at any rate. These would be inclined to magnify the\r\n",
      "difficulties of a distribution. Others of them, a numerous body of whose\r\n",
      "citizens are creditors to the public beyond proportion of the State\r\n",
      "in the total amount of the national debt, would be strenuous for some\r\n",
      "equitable and effective provision. The procrastinations of the former\r\n",
      "would excite the resentments of the latter. The settlement of a rule\r\n",
      "would, in the meantime, be postponed by real differences of opinion and\r\n",
      "affected delays. The citizens of the States interested would clamour;\r\n",
      "foreign powers would urge for the satisfaction of their just demands,\r\n",
      "and the peace of the States would be hazarded to the double contingency\r\n",
      "of external invasion and internal contention.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Suppose the difficulties of agreeing upon a rule surmounted, and the\r\n",
      "apportionment made. Still there is great room to suppose that the rule\r\n",
      "agreed upon would, upon experiment, be found to bear harder upon\r\n",
      "some States than upon others. Those which were sufferers by it would\r\n",
      "naturally seek for a mitigation of the burden. The others would as\r\n",
      "naturally be disinclined to a revision, which was likely to end in an\r\n",
      "increase of their own incumbrances. Their refusal would be too plausible\r\n",
      "a pretext to the complaining States to withhold their contributions, not\r\n",
      "to be embraced with avidity; and the non-compliance of these States\r\n",
      "with their engagements would be a ground of bitter discussion and\r\n",
      "altercation. If even the rule adopted should in practice justify the\r\n",
      "equality of its principle, still delinquencies in payments on the part\r\n",
      "of some of the States would result from a diversity of other causes--the\r\n",
      "real deficiency of resources; the mismanagement of their finances;\r\n",
      "accidental disorders in the management of the government; and, in\r\n",
      "addition to the rest, the reluctance with which men commonly part with\r\n",
      "money for purposes that have outlived the exigencies which produced\r\n",
      "them, and interfere with the supply of immediate wants. Delinquencies,\r\n",
      "from whatever causes, would be productive of complaints, recriminations,\r\n",
      "and quarrels. There is, perhaps, nothing more likely to disturb the\r\n",
      "tranquillity of nations than their being bound to mutual contributions\r\n",
      "for any common object that does not yield an equal and coincident\r\n",
      "benefit. For it is an observation, as true as it is trite, that there is\r\n",

      "Laws in violation of private contracts, as they amount to aggressions\r\n",

      "preside over the legislations of the individual States hereafter, if\r\n",

      "have, notwithstanding, been productive of the signal advantage of\r\n",
      "rendering sudden conquests impracticable, and of preventing that\r\n",
      "rapid desolation which used to mark the progress of war prior to their\r\n",
      "introduction. The art of fortification has contributed to the same ends.\r\n",
      "The nations of Europe are encircled with chains of fortified places,\r\n",
      "which mutually obstruct invasion. Campaigns are wasted in reducing two\r\n",
      "or three frontier garrisons, to gain admittance into an enemy's country.\r\n",
      "Similar impediments occur at every step, to exhaust the strength and\r\n",

      "penetrate into the heart of a neighboring country almost as soon as\r\n",
      "intelligence of its approach could be received; but now a comparatively\r\n",

      "of one much more considerable. The history of war, in that quarter\r\n",
      "of the globe, is no longer a history of nations subdued and empires\r\n",
      "overturned, but of towns taken and retaken; of battles that decide\r\n",

      "The want of fortifications, leaving the frontiers of one state open\r\n",

      "little difficulty, overrun their less populous neighbors. Conquests\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "This picture is not too highly wrought; though, I confess, it would not\r\n",
      "long remain a just one. Safety from external danger is the most powerful\r\n",
      "director of national conduct. Even the ardent love of liberty will,\r\n",
      "after a time, give way to its dictates. The violent destruction of life\r\n",
      "and property incident to war, the continual effort and alarm attendant\r\n",

      "connection subsists between his reason and his self-love, his opinions\r\n",

      "most frivolous and fanciful distinctions have been sufficient to kindle\r\n",
      "their unfriendly passions and excite their most violent conflicts. But\r\n",
      "the most common and durable source of factions has been the various\r\n",
      "and unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those who are\r\n",
      "without property have ever formed distinct interests in society.\r\n",
      "Those who are creditors, and those who are debtors, fall under a\r\n",
      "like discrimination. A landed interest, a manufacturing interest, a\r\n",
      "mercantile interest, a moneyed interest, with many lesser interests,\r\n",
      "grow up of necessity in civilized nations, and divide them into\r\n",
      "different classes, actuated by different sentiments and views. The\r\n",
      "regulation of these various and interfering interests forms the\r\n",

      "to be both judges and parties at the same time; yet what are many of the\r\n",
      "most important acts of legislation, but so many judicial determinations,\r\n",
      "not indeed concerning the rights of single persons, but concerning the\r\n",
      "rights of large bodies of citizens? And what are the different classes\r\n",
      "of legislators but advocates and parties to the causes which they\r\n",
      "determine? Is a law proposed concerning private debts? It is a question\r\n",
      "to which the creditors are parties on one side and the debtors on the\r\n",
      "other. Justice ought to hold the balance between them. Yet the parties\r\n",
      "are, and must be, themselves the judges; and the most numerous party,\r\n",

      "probably by neither with a sole regard to justice and the public good.\r\n",
      "The apportionment of taxes on the various descriptions of property is\r\n",

      "cases, can such an adjustment be made at all without taking into view\r\n",
      "indirect and remote considerations, which will rarely prevail over the\r\n",
      "immediate interest which one party may find in disregarding the rights\r\n",

      "under the forms of the Constitution. When a majority is included in a\r\n",

      "to sacrifice to its ruling passion or interest both the public good\r\n",
      "and the rights of other citizens. To secure the public good and private\r\n",
      "rights against the danger of such a faction, and at the same time to\r\n",
      "preserve the spirit and the form of popular government, is then the\r\n",
      "great object to which our inquiries are directed. Let me add that it is\r\n",
      "the great desideratum by which this form of government can be rescued\r\n",
      "from the opprobrium under which it has so long labored, and be\r\n",
      "recommended to the esteem and adoption of mankind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By what means is this object attainable? Evidently by one of two only.\r\n",
      "Either the existence of the same passion or interest in a majority at\r\n",
      "the same time must be prevented, or the majority, having such coexistent\r\n",
      "passion or interest, must be rendered, by their number and local\r\n",
      "situation, unable to concert and carry into effect schemes of\r\n",
      "oppression. If the impulse and the opportunity be suffered to coincide,\r\n",
      "we well know that neither moral nor religious motives can be relied on\r\n",
      "as an adequate control. They are not found to be such on the injustice\r\n",

      "by which I mean a society consisting of a small number of citizens, who\r\n",
      "assemble and administer the government in person, can admit of no cure\r\n",
      "for the mischiefs of faction. A common passion or interest will, in\r\n",
      "almost every case, be felt by a majority of the whole; a communication\r\n",
      "and concert result from the form of government itself; and there is\r\n",
      "nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party or an\r\n",
      "obnoxious individual. Hence it is that such democracies have ever\r\n",
      "been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found\r\n",
      "incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have\r\n",
      "in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in\r\n",
      "their deaths. Theoretic politicians, who have patronized this species\r\n",
      "of government, have erroneously supposed that by reducing mankind to\r\n",
      "a perfect equality in their political rights, they would, at the same\r\n",
      "time, be perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions, their\r\n",
      "opinions, and their passions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A republic, by which I mean a government in which the scheme of\r\n",
      "representation takes place, opens a different prospect, and promises\r\n",
      "the cure for which we are seeking. Let us examine the points in which it\r\n",
      "varies from pure democracy, and we shall comprehend both the nature of\r\n",
      "the cure and the efficacy which it must derive from the Union.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The two great points of difference between a democracy and a republic\r\n",
      "are: first, the delegation of the government, in the latter, to a small\r\n",
      "number of citizens elected by the rest; secondly, the greater number of\r\n",
      "citizens, and greater sphere of country, over which the latter may be\r\n",
      "extended.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The effect of the first difference is, on the one hand, to refine and\r\n",
      "enlarge the public views, by passing them through the medium of a chosen\r\n",
      "body of citizens, whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of\r\n",
      "their country, and whose patriotism and love of justice will be least\r\n",
      "likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial considerations. Under\r\n",
      "such a regulation, it may well happen that the public voice, pronounced\r\n",
      "by the representatives of the people, will be more consonant to the\r\n",
      "public good than if pronounced by the people themselves, convened for\r\n",
      "the purpose. On the other hand, the effect may be inverted. Men of\r\n",
      "factious tempers, of local prejudices, or of sinister designs, may, by\r\n",
      "intrigue, by corruption, or by other means, first obtain the suffrages,\r\n",
      "and then betray the interests, of the people. The question resulting is,\r\n",
      "whether small or extensive republics are more favorable to the election\r\n",
      "of proper guardians of the public weal; and it is clearly decided in\r\n",
      "favor of the latter by two obvious considerations:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the first place, it is to be remarked that, however small the\r\n",
      "republic may be, the representatives must be raised to a certain number,\r\n",
      "in order to guard against the cabals of a few; and that, however large\r\n",
      "it may be, they must be limited to a certain number, in order to\r\n",
      "guard against the confusion of a multitude. Hence, the number of\r\n",
      "representatives in the two cases not being in proportion to that of\r\n",
      "the two constituents, and being proportionally greater in the small\r\n",
      "republic, it follows that, if the proportion of fit characters be not\r\n",
      "less in the large than in the small republic, the former will present a\r\n",
      "greater option, and consequently a greater probability of a fit choice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the next place, as each representative will be chosen by a greater\r\n",
      "number of citizens in the large than in the small republic, it will\r\n",
      "be more difficult for unworthy candidates to practice with success the\r\n",
      "vicious arts by which elections are too often carried; and the suffrages\r\n",
      "of the people being more free, will be more likely to centre in men who\r\n",
      "possess the most attractive merit and the most diffusive and established\r\n",
      "characters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It must be confessed that in this, as in most other cases, there is a\r\n",
      "mean, on both sides of which inconveniences will be found to lie.\r\n",
      "By enlarging too much the number of electors, you render the\r\n",
      "representatives too little acquainted with all their local circumstances\r\n",
      "and lesser interests; as by reducing it too much, you render him unduly\r\n",
      "attached to these, and too little fit to comprehend and pursue great and\r\n",
      "national objects. The federal Constitution forms a happy combination in\r\n",
      "this respect; the great and aggregate interests being referred to the\r\n",
      "national, the local and particular to the State legislatures.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The other point of difference is, the greater number of citizens\r\n",
      "and extent of territory which may be brought within the compass of\r\n",
      "republican than of democratic government; and it is this circumstance\r\n",
      "principally which renders factious combinations less to be dreaded\r\n",
      "in the former than in the latter. The smaller the society, the fewer\r\n",
      "probably will be the distinct parties and interests composing it; the\r\n",
      "fewer the distinct parties and interests, the more frequently will\r\n",
      "a majority be found of the same party; and the smaller the number of\r\n",
      "individuals composing a majority, and the smaller the compass within\r\n",
      "which they are placed, the more easily will they concert and execute\r\n",
      "their plans of oppression. Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater\r\n",
      "variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a\r\n",
      "majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights\r\n",
      "of other citizens; or if such a common motive exists, it will be more\r\n",
      "difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength, and to act\r\n",
      "in unison with each other. Besides other impediments, it may be remarked\r\n",
      "that, where there is a consciousness of unjust or dishonorable purposes,\r\n",
      "communication is always checked by distrust in proportion to the number\r\n",
      "whose concurrence is necessary.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hence, it clearly appears, that the same advantage which a republic has\r\n",
      "over a democracy, in controlling the effects of faction, is enjoyed by\r\n",
      "a large over a small republic,--is enjoyed by the Union over the\r\n",
      "States composing it. Does the advantage consist in the substitution of\r\n",
      "representatives whose enlightened views and virtuous sentiments render\r\n",
      "them superior to local prejudices and schemes of injustice? It will not\r\n",
      "be denied that the representation of the Union will be most likely\r\n",
      "to possess these requisite endowments. Does it consist in the greater\r\n",
      "security afforded by a greater variety of parties, against the event of\r\n",
      "any one party being able to outnumber and oppress the rest? In an equal\r\n",
      "degree does the increased variety of parties comprised within the\r\n",
      "Union, increase this security. Does it, in fine, consist in the greater\r\n",
      "obstacles opposed to the concert and accomplishment of the secret wishes\r\n",
      "of an unjust and interested majority? Here, again, the extent of the\r\n",
      "Union gives it the most palpable advantage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within their\r\n",
      "particular States, but will be unable to spread a general conflagration\r\n",
      "through the other States. A religious sect may degenerate into a\r\n",
      "political faction in a part of the Confederacy; but the variety of sects\r\n",
      "dispersed over the entire face of it must secure the national councils\r\n",
      "against any danger from that source. A rage for paper money, for an\r\n",
      "abolition of debts, for an equal division of property, or for any other\r\n",
      "improper or wicked project, will be less apt to pervade the whole body\r\n",

      "part. It happens, indeed, that different portions of confederated\r\n",
      "America possess each some peculiar advantage for this essential\r\n",
      "establishment. The more southern States furnish in greater abundance\r\n",
      "certain kinds of naval stores--tar, pitch, and turpentine. Their wood\r\n",
      "for the construction of ships is also of a more solid and lasting\r\n",
      "texture. The difference in the duration of the ships of which the navy\r\n",
      "might be composed, if chiefly constructed of Southern wood, would be of\r\n",
      "signal importance, either in the view of naval strength or of national\r\n",
      "economy. Some of the Southern and of the Middle States yield a greater\r\n",
      "plenty of iron, and of better quality. Seamen must chiefly be drawn\r\n",
      "from the Northern hive. The necessity of naval protection to external\r\n",
      "or maritime commerce does not require a particular elucidation, no more\r\n",

      "to foreign markets. The veins of commerce in every part will be\r\n",
      "replenished, and will acquire additional motion and vigor from a free\r\n",
      "circulation of the commodities of every part. Commercial enterprise\r\n",

      "different States. When the staple of one fails from a bad harvest or\r\n",
      "unproductive crop, it can call to its aid the staple of another.\r\n",
      "The variety, not less than the value, of products for exportation\r\n",
      "contributes to the activity of foreign commerce. It can be conducted\r\n",
      "upon much better terms with a large number of materials of a given value\r\n",

      "from the competitions of trade and from the fluctuations of markets.\r\n",
      "Particular articles may be in great demand at certain periods, and\r\n",
      "unsalable at others; but if there be a variety of articles, it can\r\n",
      "scarcely happen that they should all be at one time in the latter\r\n",
      "predicament, and on this account the operations of the merchant would\r\n",
      "be less liable to any considerable obstruction or stagnation.\r\n",

      "Union, an advantage which nature holds out to us, and which would be\r\n",
      "relinquished by separation. The United States lie at a great distance\r\n",
      "from Europe, and at a considerable distance from all other places\r\n",
      "with which they would have extensive connections of foreign trade.\r\n",
      "The passage from them to us, in a few hours, or in a single night,\r\n",
      "as between the coasts of France and Britain, and of other neighboring\r\n",

      "and in Britain they exceed this proportion.(1) There seems to be nothing\r\n",

      "regulation, might be made to furnish a considerable revenue. Upon a\r\n",
      "ratio to the importation into this State, the whole quantity imported\r\n",
      "into the United States may be estimated at four millions of gallons;\r\n",
      "which, at a shilling per gallon, would produce two hundred thousand\r\n",

      "Mississippi, and on the north an irregular line running in some\r\n",
      "instances beyond the forty-fifth degree, in others falling as low as the\r\n",
      "forty-second. The southern shore of Lake Erie lies below that latitude.\r\n",
      "Computing the distance between the thirty-first and forty-fifth degrees,\r\n",
      "it amounts to nine hundred and seventy-three common miles; computing it\r\n",
      "from thirty-one to forty-two degrees, to seven hundred and sixty-four\r\n",
      "miles and a half. Taking the mean for the distance, the amount will be\r\n",
      "eight hundred and sixty-eight miles and three-fourths. The mean distance\r\n",
      "from the Atlantic to the Mississippi does not probably exceed seven\r\n",
      "hundred and fifty miles. On a comparison of this extent with that of\r\n",
      "several countries in Europe, the practicability of rendering our system\r\n",
      "commensurate to it appears to be demonstrable. It is not a great deal\r\n",
      "larger than Germany, where a diet representing the whole empire is\r\n",
      "continually assembled; or than Poland before the late dismemberment,\r\n",
      "where another national diet was the depositary of the supreme power.\r\n",

      "not to be charged with the whole power of making and administering laws.\r\n",
      "Its jurisdiction is limited to certain enumerated objects, which concern\r\n",
      "all the members of the republic, but which are not to be attained by\r\n",
      "the separate provisions of any. The subordinate governments, which can\r\n",
      "extend their care to all those other subjects which can be separately\r\n",
      "provided for, will retain their due authority and activity. Were it\r\n",
      "proposed by the plan of the convention to abolish the governments of\r\n",
      "the particular States, its adversaries would have some ground for their\r\n",
      "objection; though it would not be difficult to show that if they were\r\n",
      "abolished the general government would be compelled, by the principle of\r\n",
      "self-preservation, to reinstate them in their proper jurisdiction.\r\n",

      "which we cannot doubt to be equally practicable. The arrangements that\r\n",
      "may be necessary for those angles and fractions of our territory which\r\n",
      "lie on our northwestern frontier, must be left to those whom further\r\n",
      "discoveries and experience will render more equal to the task.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Let it be remarked, in the third place, that the intercourse throughout\r\n",
      "the Union will be facilitated by new improvements. Roads will everywhere\r\n",
      "be shortened, and kept in better order; accommodations for travelers\r\n",
      "will be multiplied and meliorated; an interior navigation on our eastern\r\n",
      "side will be opened throughout, or nearly throughout, the whole extent\r\n",
      "of the thirteen States. The communication between the Western and\r\n",
      "Atlantic districts, and between different parts of each, will be\r\n",
      "rendered more and more easy by those numerous canals with which the\r\n",

      "it so little difficult to connect and complete.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A fourth and still more important consideration is, that as almost every\r\n",
      "State will, on one side or other, be a frontier, and will thus find, in\r\n",
      "regard to its safety, an inducement to make some sacrifices for the\r\n",
      "sake of the general protection; so the States which lie at the greatest\r\n",
      "distance from the heart of the Union, and which, of course, may partake\r\n",
      "least of the ordinary circulation of its benefits, will be at the same\r\n",
      "time immediately contiguous to foreign nations, and will consequently\r\n",
      "stand, on particular occasions, in greatest need of its strength and\r\n",
      "resources. It may be inconvenient for Georgia, or the States forming our\r\n",
      "western or northeastern borders, to send their representatives to the\r\n",
      "seat of government; but they would find it more so to struggle alone\r\n",
      "against an invading enemy, or even to support alone the whole expense of\r\n",
      "those precautions which may be dictated by the neighborhood of continual\r\n",
      "danger. If they should derive less benefit, therefore, from the Union\r\n",
      "in some respects than the less distant States, they will derive greater\r\n",
      "benefit from it in other respects, and thus the proper equilibrium will\r\n",
      "be maintained throughout.\r\n",

      "that the people of America, knit together as they are by so many cords\r\n",
      "of affection, can no longer live together as members of the same family;\r\n",
      "can no longer continue the mutual guardians of their mutual happiness;\r\n",
      "can no longer be fellow citizens of one great, respectable, and\r\n",
      "flourishing empire. Hearken not to the voice which petulantly tells you\r\n",
      "that the form of government recommended for your adoption is a novelty\r\n",
      "in the political world; that it has never yet had a place in the\r\n",
      "theories of the wildest projectors; that it rashly attempts what it is\r\n",
      "impossible to accomplish. No, my countrymen, shut your ears against\r\n",
      "this unhallowed language. Shut your hearts against the poison which\r\n",
      "it conveys; the kindred blood which flows in the veins of American\r\n",
      "citizens, the mingled blood which they have shed in defense of their\r\n",
      "sacred rights, consecrate their Union, and excite horror at the idea\r\n",

      "of America, that, whilst they have paid a decent regard to the opinions\r\n",

      "will, in fact, amount to nothing more than advice or recommendation.\r\n",
      "This penalty, whatever it may be, can only be inflicted in two ways: by\r\n",
      "the agency of the courts and ministers of justice, or by military force;\r\n",
      "by the COERCION of the magistracy, or by the COERCION of arms. The first\r\n",
      "kind can evidently apply only to men; the last kind must of necessity,\r\n",
      "be employed against bodies politic, or communities, or States. It is\r\n",
      "evident that there is no process of a court by which the observance\r\n",
      "of the laws can, in the last resort, be enforced. Sentences may be\r\n",
      "denounced against them for violations of their duty; but these sentences\r\n",
      "can only be carried into execution by the sword. In an association\r\n",
      "where the general authority is confined to the collective bodies of the\r\n",
      "communities, that compose it, every breach of the laws must involve a\r\n",
      "state of war; and military execution must become the only instrument of\r\n",

      "There was a time when we were told that breaches, by the States, of the\r\n",
      "regulations of the federal authority were not to be expected; that\r\n",
      "a sense of common interest would preside over the conduct of the\r\n",
      "respective members, and would beget a full compliance with all the\r\n",
      "constitutional requisitions of the Union. This language, at the present\r\n",
      "day, would appear as wild as a great part of what we now hear from\r\n",
      "the same quarter will be thought, when we shall have received further\r\n",
      "lessons from that best oracle of wisdom, experience. It at all times\r\n",
      "betrayed an ignorance of the true springs by which human conduct is\r\n",
      "actuated, and belied the original inducements to the establishment of\r\n",
      "civil power. Why has government been instituted at all? Because the\r\n",
      "passions of men will not conform to the dictates of reason and justice,\r\n",
      "without constraint. Has it been found that bodies of men act with more\r\n",
      "rectitude or greater disinterestedness than individuals? The contrary\r\n",
      "of this has been inferred by all accurate observers of the conduct of\r\n",
      "mankind; and the inference is founded upon obvious reasons. Regard to\r\n",
      "reputation has a less active influence, when the infamy of a bad action\r\n",
      "is to be divided among a number than when it is to fall singly upon\r\n",
      "one. A spirit of faction, which is apt to mingle its poison in the\r\n",
      "deliberations of all bodies of men, will often hurry the persons of whom\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "In addition to all this, there is, in the nature of sovereign power,\r\n",

      "exercise of it, to look with an evil eye upon all external attempts to\r\n",
      "restrain or direct its operations. From this spirit it happens, that\r\n",
      "in every political association which is formed upon the principle of\r\n",

      "opponents of the proposed Constitution. It must carry its agency to\r\n",
      "the persons of the citizens. It must stand in need of no intermediate\r\n",
      "legislations; but must itself be empowered to employ the arm of the\r\n",
      "ordinary magistrate to execute its own resolutions. The majesty of the\r\n",
      "national authority must be manifested through the medium of the courts\r\n",

      "by the government of the particular States.\r\n",

      "obstruct the execution of its laws, and bring the matter to the same\r\n",
      "issue of force, with the necessity of which the opposite scheme is\r\n",
      "reproached.\r\n",

      "ACTIVE RESISTANCE. If the interposition of the State legislatures be\r\n",
      "necessary to give effect to a measure of the Union, they have only NOT\r\n",
      "TO ACT, or TO ACT EVASIVELY, and the measure is defeated. This neglect\r\n",

      "violent exertion of an unconstitutional power. No omissions nor evasions\r\n",
      "would answer the end. They would be obliged to act, and in such a manner\r\n",
      "as would leave no doubt that they had encroached on the national rights.\r\n",
      "An experiment of this nature would always be hazardous in the face of a\r\n",
      "constitution in any degree competent to its own defense, and of a\r\n",
      "people enlightened enough to distinguish between a legal exercise and\r\n",
      "an illegal usurpation of authority. The success of it would require not\r\n",
      "merely a factious majority in the legislature, but the concurrence of\r\n",
      "the courts of justice and of the body of the people. If the judges were\r\n",

      "Though the ancient feudal systems were not, strictly speaking,\r\n",
      "confederacies, yet they partook of the nature of that species of\r\n",
      "association. There was a common head, chieftain, or sovereign, whose\r\n",
      "authority extended over the whole nation; and a number of subordinate\r\n",
      "vassals, or feudatories, who had large portions of land allotted to\r\n",

      "sovereign, within his particular demesnes. The consequences of this\r\n",
      "situation were a continual opposition to authority of the sovereign, and\r\n",
      "frequent wars between the great barons or chief feudatories themselves.\r\n",
      "The power of the head of the nation was commonly too weak, either\r\n",
      "to preserve the public peace, or to protect the people against the\r\n",
      "oppressions of their immediate lords. This period of European affairs is\r\n",
      "emphatically styled by historians, the times of feudal anarchy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the sovereign happened to be a man of vigorous and warlike temper\r\n",
      "and of superior abilities, he would acquire a personal weight and\r\n",
      "influence, which answered, for the time, the purpose of a more regular\r\n",
      "authority. But in general, the power of the barons triumphed over that\r\n",
      "of the prince; and in many instances his dominion was entirely thrown\r\n",
      "off, and the great fiefs were erected into independent principalities or\r\n",
      "States. In those instances in which the monarch finally prevailed over\r\n",
      "his vassals, his success was chiefly owing to the tyranny of those\r\n",
      "vassals over their dependents. The barons, or nobles, equally the\r\n",
      "enemies of the sovereign and the oppressors of the common people, were\r\n",
      "dreaded and detested by both; till mutual danger and mutual interest\r\n",
      "effected a union between them fatal to the power of the aristocracy. Had\r\n",
      "the nobles, by a conduct of clemency and justice, preserved the fidelity\r\n",
      "and devotion of their retainers and followers, the contests between them\r\n",

      "abridgment or subversion of the royal authority.\r\n",

      "This is not an assertion founded merely in speculation or conjecture.\r\n",
      "Among other illustrations of its truth which might be cited, Scotland\r\n",

      "early day, introduced into that kingdom, uniting the nobles and\r\n",
      "their dependants by ties equivalent to those of kindred, rendered the\r\n",
      "aristocracy a constant overmatch for the power of the monarch, till the\r\n",
      "incorporation with England subdued its fierce and ungovernable spirit,\r\n",

      "The members retained the character of independent and sovereign states,\r\n",

      "aggressing party; to employ the whole force of the confederacy against\r\n",
      "the disobedient; to admit new members. The Amphictyons were the\r\n",
      "guardians of religion, and of the immense riches belonging to the temple\r\n",
      "of Delphos, where they had the right of jurisdiction in controversies\r\n",
      "between the inhabitants and those who came to consult the oracle. As a\r\n",
      "further provision for the efficacy of the federal powers, they took an\r\n",
      "oath mutually to defend and protect the united cities, to punish\r\n",
      "the violators of this oath, and to inflict vengeance on sacrilegious\r\n",
      "despoilers of the temple.\r\n",

      "they exceed the powers enumerated in the articles of confederation. The\r\n",
      "Amphictyons had in their hands the superstition of the times, one of the\r\n",
      "principal engines by which government was then maintained; they had a\r\n",
      "declared authority to use coercion against refractory cities, and were\r\n",
      "bound by oath to exert this authority on the necessary occasions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Very different, nevertheless, was the experiment from the theory.\r\n",

      "deputies appointed wholly by the cities in their political capacities;\r\n",
      "and exercised over them in the same capacities. Hence the weakness,\r\n",
      "the disorders, and finally the destruction of the confederacy. The\r\n",
      "more powerful members, instead of being kept in awe and subordination,\r\n",
      "tyrannized successively over all the rest. Athens, as we learn from\r\n",
      "Demosthenes, was the arbiter of Greece seventy-three years. The\r\n",
      "Lacedaemonians next governed it twenty-nine years; at a subsequent\r\n",
      "period, after the battle of Leuctra, the Thebans had their turn of\r\n",
      "domination.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It happened but too often, according to Plutarch, that the deputies of\r\n",
      "the strongest cities awed and corrupted those of the weaker; and that\r\n",
      "judgment went in favor of the most powerful party.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Even in the midst of defensive and dangerous wars with Persia and\r\n",
      "Macedon, the members never acted in concert, and were, more or fewer\r\n",
      "of them, eternally the dupes or the hirelings of the common enemy.\r\n",
      "The intervals of foreign war were filled up by domestic vicissitudes\r\n",
      "convulsions, and carnage.\r\n",

      "After the conclusion of the war with Xerxes, it appears that the\r\n",
      "Lacedaemonians required that a number of the cities should be turned\r\n",
      "out of the confederacy for the unfaithful part they had acted. The\r\n",

      "such a measure than themselves, and would become masters of the public\r\n",
      "deliberations, vigorously opposed and defeated the attempt. This piece\r\n",
      "of history proves at once the inefficiency of the union, the ambition\r\n",
      "and jealousy of its most powerful members, and the dependent and\r\n",
      "degraded condition of the rest. The smaller members, though entitled by\r\n",
      "the theory of their system to revolve in equal pride and majesty around\r\n",
      "the common center, had become, in fact, satellites of the orbs of\r\n",
      "primary magnitude.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Had the Greeks, says the Abbe Milot, been as wise as they were\r\n",
      "courageous, they would have been admonished by experience of the\r\n",
      "necessity of a closer union, and would have availed themselves of\r\n",
      "the peace which followed their success against the Persian arms, to\r\n",
      "establish such a reformation. Instead of this obvious policy, Athens\r\n",
      "and Sparta, inflated with the victories and the glory they had acquired,\r\n",
      "became first rivals and then enemies; and did each other infinitely more\r\n",
      "mischief than they had suffered from Xerxes. Their mutual jealousies,\r\n",
      "fears, hatreds, and injuries ended in the celebrated Peloponnesian war;\r\n",
      "which itself ended in the ruin and slavery of the Athenians who had\r\n",

      "As a weak government, when not at war, is ever agitated by internal\r\n",
      "dissentions, so these never fail to bring on fresh calamities from\r\n",
      "abroad. The Phocians having ploughed up some consecrated ground\r\n",
      "belonging to the temple of Apollo, the Amphictyonic council, according\r\n",
      "to the superstition of the age, imposed a fine on the sacrilegious\r\n",
      "offenders. The Phocians, being abetted by Athens and Sparta, refused to\r\n",
      "submit to the decree. The Thebans, with others of the cities, undertook\r\n",
      "to maintain the authority of the Amphictyons, and to avenge the violated\r\n",
      "god. The latter, being the weaker party, invited the assistance of\r\n",
      "Philip of Macedon, who had secretly fostered the contest. Philip gladly\r\n",
      "seized the opportunity of executing the designs he had long planned\r\n",
      "against the liberties of Greece. By his intrigues and bribes he won\r\n",
      "over to his interests the popular leaders of several cities; by their\r\n",
      "influence and votes, gained admission into the Amphictyonic council; and\r\n",
      "by his arts and his arms, made himself master of the confederacy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Such were the consequences of the fallacious principle on which this\r\n",
      "interesting establishment was founded. Had Greece, says a judicious\r\n",
      "observer on her fate, been united by a stricter confederation, and\r\n",
      "persevered in her union, she would never have worn the chains of\r\n",
      "Macedon; and might have proved a barrier to the vast projects of Rome.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Achaean league, as it is called, was another society of Grecian\r\n",
      "republics, which supplies us with valuable instruction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Union here was far more intimate, and its organization much wiser,\r\n",
      "than in the preceding instance. It will accordingly appear, that though\r\n",
      "not exempt from a similar catastrophe, it by no means equally deserved\r\n",
      "it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The cities composing this league retained their municipal jurisdiction,\r\n",
      "appointed their own officers, and enjoyed a perfect equality. The\r\n",
      "senate, in which they were represented, had the sole and exclusive right\r\n",
      "of peace and war; of sending and receiving ambassadors; of entering into\r\n",
      "treaties and alliances; of appointing a chief magistrate or praetor, as\r\n",
      "he was called, who commanded their armies, and who, with the advice and\r\n",
      "consent of ten of the senators, not only administered the government in\r\n",
      "the recess of the senate, but had a great share in its deliberations,\r\n",
      "when assembled. According to the primitive constitution, there were two\r\n",
      "praetors associated in the administration; but on trial a single one was\r\n",
      "preferred.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It appears that the cities had all the same laws and customs, the\r\n",
      "same weights and measures, and the same money. But how far this\r\n",
      "effect proceeded from the authority of the federal council is left in\r\n",
      "uncertainty. It is said only that the cities were in a manner compelled\r\n",
      "to receive the same laws and usages. When Lacedaemon was brought into\r\n",
      "the league by Philopoemen, it was attended with an abolition of the\r\n",
      "institutions and laws of Lycurgus, and an adoption of those of the\r\n",
      "Achaeans. The Amphictyonic confederacy, of which she had been a member,\r\n",
      "left her in the full exercise of her government and her legislation.\r\n",
      "This circumstance alone proves a very material difference in the genius\r\n",
      "of the two systems.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is much to be regretted that such imperfect monuments remain of\r\n",
      "this curious political fabric. Could its interior structure and regular\r\n",
      "operation be ascertained, it is probable that more light would be thrown\r\n",
      "by it on the science of federal government, than by any of the like\r\n",
      "experiments with which we are acquainted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One important fact seems to be witnessed by all the historians who take\r\n",
      "notice of Achaean affairs. It is, that as well after the renovation of\r\n",
      "the league by Aratus, as before its dissolution by the arts of\r\n",
      "Macedon, there was infinitely more of moderation and justice in the\r\n",
      "administration of its government, and less of violence and sedition in\r\n",
      "the people, than were to be found in any of the cities exercising SINGLY\r\n",
      "all the prerogatives of sovereignty. The Abbe Mably, in his observations\r\n",
      "on Greece, says that the popular government, which was so tempestuous\r\n",
      "elsewhere, caused no disorders in the members of the Achaean republic,\r\n",
      "BECAUSE IT WAS THERE TEMPERED BY THE GENERAL AUTHORITY AND LAWS OF THE\r\n",
      "CONFEDERACY.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We are not to conclude too hastily, however, that faction did not, in\r\n",
      "a certain degree, agitate the particular cities; much less that a due\r\n",
      "subordination and harmony reigned in the general system. The contrary is\r\n",
      "sufficiently displayed in the vicissitudes and fate of the republic.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whilst the Amphictyonic confederacy remained, that of the Achaeans,\r\n",
      "which comprehended the less important cities only, made little figure on\r\n",
      "the theatre of Greece. When the former became a victim to Macedon,\r\n",
      "the latter was spared by the policy of Philip and Alexander. Under the\r\n",
      "successors of these princes, however, a different policy prevailed.\r\n",
      "The arts of division were practiced among the Achaeans. Each city was\r\n",
      "seduced into a separate interest; the union was dissolved. Some of the\r\n",
      "cities fell under the tyranny of Macedonian garrisons; others under that\r\n",
      "of usurpers springing out of their own confusions. Shame and oppression\r\n",
      "erelong awaken their love of liberty. A few cities reunited. Their\r\n",
      "example was followed by others, as opportunities were found of\r\n",
      "cutting off their tyrants. The league soon embraced almost the whole\r\n",
      "Peloponnesus. Macedon saw its progress; but was hindered by internal\r\n",
      "dissensions from stopping it. All Greece caught the enthusiasm and\r\n",
      "seemed ready to unite in one confederacy, when the jealousy and envy in\r\n",
      "Sparta and Athens, of the rising glory of the Achaeans, threw a fatal\r\n",
      "damp on the enterprise. The dread of the Macedonian power induced the\r\n",
      "league to court the alliance of the Kings of Egypt and Syria, who, as\r\n",
      "successors of Alexander, were rivals of the king of Macedon. This policy\r\n",
      "was defeated by Cleomenes, king of Sparta, who was led by his ambition\r\n",
      "to make an unprovoked attack on his neighbors, the Achaeans, and who,\r\n",
      "as an enemy to Macedon, had interest enough with the Egyptian and Syrian\r\n",
      "princes to effect a breach of their engagements with the league.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Achaeans were now reduced to the dilemma of submitting to Cleomenes,\r\n",
      "or of supplicating the aid of Macedon, its former oppressor. The latter\r\n",
      "expedient was adopted. The contests of the Greeks always afforded a\r\n",
      "pleasing opportunity to that powerful neighbor of intermeddling in their\r\n",
      "affairs. A Macedonian army quickly appeared. Cleomenes was vanquished.\r\n",
      "The Achaeans soon experienced, as often happens, that a victorious and\r\n",
      "powerful ally is but another name for a master. All that their most\r\n",
      "abject compliances could obtain from him was a toleration of the\r\n",
      "exercise of their laws. Philip, who was now on the throne of Macedon,\r\n",
      "soon provoked by his tyrannies, fresh combinations among the Greeks. The\r\n",
      "Achaeans, though weakened by internal dissensions and by the revolt\r\n",
      "of Messene, one of its members, being joined by the AEtolians and\r\n",
      "Athenians, erected the standard of opposition. Finding themselves,\r\n",
      "though thus supported, unequal to the undertaking, they once more had\r\n",
      "recourse to the dangerous expedient of introducing the succor of foreign\r\n",
      "arms. The Romans, to whom the invitation was made, eagerly embraced\r\n",
      "it. Philip was conquered; Macedon subdued. A new crisis ensued to\r\n",
      "the league. Dissensions broke out among it members. These the Romans\r\n",
      "fostered. Callicrates and other popular leaders became mercenary\r\n",
      "instruments for inveigling their countrymen. The more effectually to\r\n",
      "nourish discord and disorder the Romans had, to the astonishment of\r\n",
      "those who confided in their sincerity, already proclaimed universal\r\n",
      "liberty(1) throughout Greece. With the same insidious views, they now\r\n",
      "seduced the members from the league, by representing to their pride the\r\n",
      "violation it committed on their sovereignty. By these arts this union,\r\n",
      "the last hope of Greece, the last hope of ancient liberty, was torn into\r\n",
      "pieces; and such imbecility and distraction introduced, that the arms of\r\n",
      "Rome found little difficulty in completing the ruin which their arts\r\n",
      "had commenced. The Achaeans were cut to pieces, and Achaia loaded with\r\n",
      "chains, under which it is groaning at this hour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I have thought it not superfluous to give the outlines of this important\r\n",
      "portion of history; both because it teaches more than one lesson, and\r\n",
      "because, as a supplement to the outlines of the Achaean constitution,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "THE examples of ancient confederacies, cited in my last paper, have not\r\n",
      "exhausted the source of experimental instruction on this subject. There\r\n",
      "are existing institutions, founded on a similar principle, which\r\n",
      "merit particular consideration. The first which presents itself is the\r\n",
      "Germanic body.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the early ages of Christianity, Germany was occupied by seven\r\n",
      "distinct nations, who had no common chief. The Franks, one of the\r\n",
      "number, having conquered the Gauls, established the kingdom which has\r\n",
      "taken its name from them. In the ninth century Charlemagne, its warlike\r\n",
      "monarch, carried his victorious arms in every direction; and Germany\r\n",
      "became a part of his vast dominions. On the dismemberment, which\r\n",
      "took place under his sons, this part was erected into a separate and\r\n",
      "independent empire. Charlemagne and his immediate descendants possessed\r\n",
      "the reality, as well as the ensigns and dignity of imperial power.\r\n",
      "But the principal vassals, whose fiefs had become hereditary, and\r\n",
      "who composed the national diets which Charlemagne had not abolished,\r\n",
      "gradually threw off the yoke and advanced to sovereign jurisdiction\r\n",
      "and independence. The force of imperial sovereignty was insufficient\r\n",
      "to restrain such powerful dependants; or to preserve the unity and\r\n",
      "tranquillity of the empire. The most furious private wars, accompanied\r\n",
      "with every species of calamity, were carried on between the different\r\n",
      "princes and states. The imperial authority, unable to maintain the\r\n",
      "public order, declined by degrees till it was almost extinct in the\r\n",
      "anarchy, which agitated the long interval between the death of the last\r\n",
      "emperor of the Suabian, and the accession of the first emperor of\r\n",
      "the Austrian lines. In the eleventh century the emperors enjoyed full\r\n",
      "sovereignty: In the fifteenth they had little more than the symbols and\r\n",
      "decorations of power.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Out of this feudal system, which has itself many of the important\r\n",
      "features of a confederacy, has grown the federal system which\r\n",
      "constitutes the Germanic empire. Its powers are vested in a diet\r\n",
      "representing the component members of the confederacy; in the emperor,\r\n",
      "who is the executive magistrate, with a negative on the decrees of the\r\n",
      "diet; and in the imperial chamber and the aulic council, two judiciary\r\n",
      "tribunals having supreme jurisdiction in controversies which concern the\r\n",
      "empire, or which happen among its members.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The diet possesses the general power of legislating for the empire; of\r\n",
      "making war and peace; contracting alliances; assessing quotas of troops\r\n",
      "and money; constructing fortresses; regulating coin; admitting new\r\n",
      "members; and subjecting disobedient members to the ban of the empire,\r\n",
      "by which the party is degraded from his sovereign rights and his\r\n",
      "possessions forfeited. The members of the confederacy are expressly\r\n",
      "restricted from entering into compacts prejudicial to the empire; from\r\n",
      "imposing tolls and duties on their mutual intercourse, without the\r\n",
      "consent of the emperor and diet; from altering the value of money; from\r\n",
      "doing injustice to one another; or from affording assistance or retreat\r\n",
      "to disturbers of the public peace. And the ban is denounced against such\r\n",
      "as shall violate any of these restrictions. The members of the diet, as\r\n",
      "such, are subject in all cases to be judged by the emperor and diet, and\r\n",
      "in their private capacities by the aulic council and imperial chamber.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The prerogatives of the emperor are numerous. The most important of them\r\n",
      "are: his exclusive right to make propositions to the diet; to negative\r\n",
      "its resolutions; to name ambassadors; to confer dignities and titles; to\r\n",
      "fill vacant electorates; to found universities; to grant privileges not\r\n",
      "injurious to the states of the empire; to receive and apply the public\r\n",
      "revenues; and generally to watch over the public safety. In certain\r\n",
      "cases, the electors form a council to him. In quality of emperor, he\r\n",
      "possesses no territory within the empire, nor receives any revenue\r\n",
      "for his support. But his revenue and dominions, in other qualities,\r\n",
      "constitute him one of the most powerful princes in Europe.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From such a parade of constitutional powers, in the representatives and\r\n",
      "head of this confederacy, the natural supposition would be, that it must\r\n",
      "form an exception to the general character which belongs to its kindred\r\n",
      "systems. Nothing would be further from the reality. The fundamental\r\n",
      "principle on which it rests, that the empire is a community of\r\n",
      "sovereigns, that the diet is a representation of sovereigns and that the\r\n",
      "laws are addressed to sovereigns, renders the empire a nerveless body,\r\n",
      "incapable of regulating its own members, insecure against external\r\n",
      "dangers, and agitated with unceasing fermentations in its own bowels.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The history of Germany is a history of wars between the emperor and the\r\n",
      "princes and states; of wars among the princes and states themselves;\r\n",
      "of the licentiousness of the strong, and the oppression of the weak; of\r\n",
      "foreign intrusions, and foreign intrigues; of requisitions of men and\r\n",
      "money disregarded, or partially complied with; of attempts to enforce\r\n",
      "them, altogether abortive, or attended with slaughter and desolation,\r\n",
      "involving the innocent with the guilty; of general imbecility,\r\n",
      "confusion, and misery.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the sixteenth century, the emperor, with one part of the empire on\r\n",
      "his side, was seen engaged against the other princes and states. In one\r\n",
      "of the conflicts, the emperor himself was put to flight, and very near\r\n",
      "being made prisoner by the elector of Saxony. The late king of Prussia\r\n",
      "was more than once pitted against his imperial sovereign; and commonly\r\n",
      "proved an overmatch for him. Controversies and wars among the members\r\n",
      "themselves have been so common, that the German annals are crowded\r\n",
      "with the bloody pages which describe them. Previous to the peace of\r\n",
      "Westphalia, Germany was desolated by a war of thirty years, in which the\r\n",
      "emperor, with one half of the empire, was on one side, and Sweden, with\r\n",
      "the other half, on the opposite side. Peace was at length negotiated,\r\n",
      "and dictated by foreign powers; and the articles of it, to which\r\n",
      "foreign powers are parties, made a fundamental part of the Germanic\r\n",
      "constitution.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If the nation happens, on any emergency, to be more united by the\r\n",
      "necessity of self-defense, its situation is still deplorable. Military\r\n",
      "preparations must be preceded by so many tedious discussions, arising\r\n",
      "from the jealousies, pride, separate views, and clashing pretensions of\r\n",
      "sovereign bodies, that before the diet can settle the arrangements, the\r\n",
      "enemy are in the field; and before the federal troops are ready to take\r\n",
      "it, are retiring into winter quarters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The small body of national troops, which has been judged necessary in\r\n",
      "time of peace, is defectively kept up, badly paid, infected with\r\n",
      "local prejudices, and supported by irregular and disproportionate\r\n",
      "contributions to the treasury.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The impossibility of maintaining order and dispensing justice among\r\n",
      "these sovereign subjects, produced the experiment of dividing the\r\n",
      "empire into nine or ten circles or districts; of giving them an interior\r\n",
      "organization, and of charging them with the military execution of the\r\n",
      "laws against delinquent and contumacious members. This experiment\r\n",
      "has only served to demonstrate more fully the radical vice of the\r\n",
      "constitution. Each circle is the miniature picture of the deformities of\r\n",
      "this political monster. They either fail to execute their commissions,\r\n",
      "or they do it with all the devastation and carnage of civil war.\r\n",
      "Sometimes whole circles are defaulters; and then they increase the\r\n",
      "mischief which they were instituted to remedy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We may form some judgment of this scheme of military coercion from a\r\n",
      "sample given by Thuanus. In Donawerth, a free and imperial city of the\r\n",
      "circle of Suabia, the Abbe de St. Croix enjoyed certain immunities\r\n",
      "which had been reserved to him. In the exercise of these, on some public\r\n",
      "occasions, outrages were committed on him by the people of the city. The\r\n",
      "consequence was that the city was put under the ban of the empire, and\r\n",
      "the Duke of Bavaria, though director of another circle, obtained an\r\n",
      "appointment to enforce it. He soon appeared before the city with a\r\n",
      "corps of ten thousand troops, and finding it a fit occasion, as he had\r\n",
      "secretly intended from the beginning, to revive an antiquated claim, on\r\n",
      "the pretext that his ancestors had suffered the place to be dismembered\r\n",
      "from his territory,(1) he took possession of it in his own name,\r\n",
      "disarmed, and punished the inhabitants, and reannexed the city to his\r\n",
      "domains.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It may be asked, perhaps, what has so long kept this disjointed machine\r\n",
      "from falling entirely to pieces? The answer is obvious: The weakness of\r\n",
      "most of the members, who are unwilling to expose themselves to the\r\n",
      "mercy of foreign powers; the weakness of most of the principal members,\r\n",
      "compared with the formidable powers all around them; the vast weight\r\n",
      "and influence which the emperor derives from his separate and hereditary\r\n",
      "dominions; and the interest he feels in preserving a system with which\r\n",
      "his family pride is connected, and which constitutes him the first\r\n",
      "prince in Europe;--these causes support a feeble and precarious Union;\r\n",
      "whilst the repellant quality, incident to the nature of sovereignty,\r\n",
      "and which time continually strengthens, prevents any reform whatever,\r\n",
      "founded on a proper consolidation. Nor is it to be imagined, if this\r\n",
      "obstacle could be surmounted, that the neighboring powers would suffer\r\n",
      "a revolution to take place which would give to the empire the force\r\n",
      "and preeminence to which it is entitled. Foreign nations have long\r\n",
      "considered themselves as interested in the changes made by events in\r\n",
      "this constitution; and have, on various occasions, betrayed their policy\r\n",
      "of perpetuating its anarchy and weakness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If more direct examples were wanting, Poland, as a government over local\r\n",
      "sovereigns, might not improperly be taken notice of. Nor could any proof\r\n",
      "more striking be given of the calamities flowing from such institutions.\r\n",
      "Equally unfit for self-government and self-defense, it has long been at\r\n",
      "the mercy of its powerful neighbors; who have lately had the mercy to\r\n",
      "disburden it of one third of its people and territories.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The connection among the Swiss cantons scarcely amounts to a\r\n",
      "confederacy; though it is sometimes cited as an instance of the\r\n",
      "stability of such institutions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They have no common treasury; no common troops even in war; no common\r\n",
      "coin; no common judicatory; nor any other common mark of sovereignty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They are kept together by the peculiarity of their topographical\r\n",
      "position; by their individual weakness and insignificancy; by the fear\r\n",
      "of powerful neighbors, to one of which they were formerly subject;\r\n",
      "by the few sources of contention among a people of such simple and\r\n",
      "homogeneous manners; by their joint interest in their dependent\r\n",
      "possessions; by the mutual aid they stand in need of, for suppressing\r\n",
      "insurrections and rebellions, an aid expressly stipulated and often\r\n",
      "required and afforded; and by the necessity of some regular and\r\n",
      "permanent provision for accommodating disputes among the cantons. The\r\n",
      "provision is, that the parties at variance shall each choose four judges\r\n",
      "out of the neutral cantons, who, in case of disagreement, choose\r\n",
      "an umpire. This tribunal, under an oath of impartiality, pronounces\r\n",
      "definitive sentence, which all the cantons are bound to enforce. The\r\n",
      "competency of this regulation may be estimated by a clause in their\r\n",
      "treaty of 1683, with Victor Amadeus of Savoy; in which he obliges\r\n",
      "himself to interpose as mediator in disputes between the cantons, and to\r\n",
      "employ force, if necessary, against the contumacious party.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So far as the peculiarity of their case will admit of comparison with\r\n",
      "that of the United States, it serves to confirm the principle intended\r\n",
      "to be established. Whatever efficacy the union may have had in ordinary\r\n",
      "cases, it appears that the moment a cause of difference sprang up,\r\n",
      "capable of trying its strength, it failed. The controversies on the\r\n",
      "subject of religion, which in three instances have kindled violent and\r\n",
      "bloody contests, may be said, in fact, to have severed the league. The\r\n",
      "Protestant and Catholic cantons have since had their separate diets,\r\n",
      "where all the most important concerns are adjusted, and which have left\r\n",
      "the general diet little other business than to take care of the common\r\n",
      "bailages.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That separation had another consequence, which merits attention. It\r\n",
      "produced opposite alliances with foreign powers: of Berne, at the\r\n",

      "In critical emergencies, the States-General are often compelled to\r\n",
      "overleap their constitutional bounds. In 1688, they concluded a treaty\r\n",
      "of themselves at the risk of their heads. The treaty of Westphalia, in\r\n",
      "1648, by which their independence was formerly and finally recognized,\r\n",
      "was concluded without the consent of Zealand. Even as recently as the\r\n",
      "last treaty of peace with Great Britain, the constitutional principle\r\n",
      "of unanimity was departed from. A weak constitution must necessarily\r\n",
      "terminate in dissolution, for want of proper powers, or the usurpation\r\n",
      "of powers requisite for the public safety. Whether the usurpation,\r\n",
      "when once begun, will stop at the salutary point, or go forward to\r\n",

      "while those at a distance from danger were, for the most part, as remiss\r\n",
      "as the others were diligent, in their exertions. The immediate pressure\r\n",

      "America. But this kind of logical legerdemain will never counteract the\r\n",
      "plain suggestions of justice and common-sense. It may happen that this\r\n",
      "majority of States is a small minority of the people of America;(3) and\r\n",

      "importance in the political scale, would be not merely to be insensible\r\n",
      "to the love of power, but even to sacrifice the desire of equality. It\r\n",
      "is neither rational to expect the first, nor just to require the last.\r\n",
      "The smaller States, considering how peculiarly their safety and welfare\r\n",

      "always comprehend a majority of the Union. But this does not obviate\r\n",
      "the impropriety of an equal vote between States of the most unequal\r\n",
      "dimensions and populousness; nor is the inference accurate in point\r\n",
      "of fact; for we can enumerate nine States which contain less than a\r\n",
      "majority of the people;(4) and it is constitutionally possible that\r\n",
      "these nine may give the vote. Besides, there are matters of considerable\r\n",
      "moment determinable by a bare majority; and there are others, concerning\r\n",
      "which doubts have been entertained, which, if interpreted in favor of\r\n",
      "the sufficiency of a vote of seven States, would extend its operation\r\n",

      "a decision), is, in its tendency, to subject the sense of the greater\r\n",
      "number to that of the lesser. Congress, from the nonattendance of a few\r\n",
      "States, have been frequently in the situation of a Polish diet, where a\r\n",

      "has an effect the reverse of what is expected from it in theory. The\r\n",
      "necessity of unanimity in public bodies, or of something approaching\r\n",
      "towards it, has been founded upon a supposition that it would contribute\r\n",
      "to security. But its real operation is to embarrass the administration,\r\n",
      "to destroy the energy of the government, and to substitute the pleasure,\r\n",

      "the majority, in order that something may be done, must conform to the\r\n",
      "views of the minority; and thus the sense of the smaller number\r\n",
      "will overrule that of the greater, and give a tone to the national\r\n",
      "proceedings. Hence, tedious delays; continual negotiation and intrigue;\r\n",
      "contemptible compromises of the public good. And yet, in such a system,\r\n",
      "it is even happy when such compromises can take place: for upon some\r\n",
      "occasions things will not admit of accommodation; and then the measures\r\n",
      "of government must be injuriously suspended, or fatally defeated. It\r\n",
      "is often, by the impracticability of obtaining the concurrence of the\r\n",

      "occupations and families to perform that most disagreeable duty in times\r\n",
      "of profound peace. And if they could be prevailed upon or compelled to\r\n",
      "do it, the increased expense of a frequent rotation of service, and\r\n",
      "the loss of labor and disconcertion of the industrious pursuits of\r\n",
      "individuals, would form conclusive objections to the scheme. It would\r\n",
      "be as burdensome and injurious to the public as ruinous to private\r\n",
      "citizens. The latter resource of permanent corps in the pay of the\r\n",
      "government amounts to a standing army in time of peace; a small one,\r\n",
      "indeed, but not the less real for being small. Here is a simple view of\r\n",

      "exposed, in a naked and defenseless condition, to their insults and\r\n",

      "on foot as long as they supposed the peace or safety of the community\r\n",
      "was in any degree of jeopardy. It is easy to perceive that a discretion\r\n",

      "pretenses of approaching danger! Indian hostilities, instigated by Spain\r\n",
      "or Britain, would always be at hand. Provocations to produce the desired\r\n",
      "appearances might even be given to some foreign power, and appeased\r\n",
      "again by timely concessions. If we can reasonably presume such a\r\n",
      "combination to have been formed, and that the enterprise is warranted\r\n",
      "by a sufficient prospect of success, the army, when once raised, from\r\n",

      "If, to obviate this consequence, it should be resolved to extend the\r\n",
      "prohibition to the RAISING of armies in time of peace, the United States\r\n",
      "would then exhibit the most extraordinary spectacle which the world has\r\n",
      "yet seen, that of a nation incapacitated by its Constitution to prepare\r\n",
      "for defense, before it was actually invaded. As the ceremony of a formal\r\n",
      "denunciation of war has of late fallen into disuse, the presence of an\r\n",
      "enemy within our territories must be waited for, as the legal warrant\r\n",
      "to the government to begin its levies of men for the protection of the\r\n",
      "State. We must receive the blow, before we could even prepare to return\r\n",
      "it. All that kind of policy by which nations anticipate distant danger,\r\n",
      "and meet the gathering storm, must be abstained from, as contrary to\r\n",
      "the genuine maxims of a free government. We must expose our property\r\n",

      "its natural bulwark, and would be at all times equal to the national\r\n",
      "defense. This doctrine, in substance, had like to have lost us our\r\n",
      "independence. It cost millions to the United States that might have been\r\n",
      "saved. The facts which, from our own experience, forbid a reliance\r\n",
      "of this kind, are too recent to permit us to be the dupes of such\r\n",
      "a suggestion. The steady operations of war against a regular and\r\n",
      "disciplined army can only be successfully conducted by a force of the\r\n",
      "same kind. Considerations of economy, not less than of stability and\r\n",
      "vigor, confirm this position. The American militia, in the course of the\r\n",
      "late war, have, by their valor on numerous occasions, erected eternal\r\n",
      "monuments to their fame; but the bravest of them feel and know that\r\n",
      "the liberty of their country could not have been established by their\r\n",
      "efforts alone, however great and valuable they were. War, like most\r\n",

      "perseverance, by time, and by practice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All violent policy, as it is contrary to the natural and experienced\r\n",
      "course of human affairs, defeats itself. Pennsylvania, at this instant,\r\n",
      "affords an example of the truth of this remark. The Bill of Rights of\r\n",
      "that State declares that standing armies are dangerous to liberty, and\r\n",
      "ought not to be kept up in time of peace. Pennsylvania, nevertheless, in\r\n",
      "a time of profound peace, from the existence of partial disorders in one\r\n",
      "or two of her counties, has resolved to raise a body of troops; and in\r\n",
      "all probability will keep them up as long as there is any appearance\r\n",
      "of danger to the public peace. The conduct of Massachusetts affords\r\n",
      "a lesson on the same subject, though on different ground. That State\r\n",
      "(without waiting for the sanction of Congress, as the articles of the\r\n",
      "Confederation require) was compelled to raise troops to quell a domestic\r\n",
      "insurrection, and still keeps a corps in pay to prevent a revival of the\r\n",
      "spirit of revolt. The particular constitution of Massachusetts opposed\r\n",
      "no obstacle to the measure; but the instance is still of use to instruct\r\n",
      "us that cases are likely to occur under our government, as well as under\r\n",
      "those of other nations, which will sometimes render a military force in\r\n",
      "time of peace essential to the security of the society, and that it\r\n",
      "is therefore improper in this respect to control the legislative\r\n",
      "discretion. It also teaches us, in its application to the United States,\r\n",
      "how little the rights of a feeble government are likely to be respected,\r\n",
      "even by its own constituents. And it teaches us, in addition to the\r\n",

      "prerogative, in favor of liberty, first by the barons, and afterwards\r\n",
      "by the people, till the greatest part of its most formidable pretensions\r\n",
      "became extinct. But it was not till the revolution in 1688, which\r\n",
      "elevated the Prince of Orange to the throne of Great Britain, that\r\n",
      "English liberty was completely triumphant. As incident to the undefined\r\n",
      "power of making war, an acknowledged prerogative of the crown, Charles\r\n",
      "II. had, by his own authority, kept on foot in time of peace a body of\r\n",
      "5,000 regular troops. And this number James II. increased to 30,000;\r\n",
      "who were paid out of his civil list. At the revolution, to abolish the\r\n",
      "exercise of so dangerous an authority, it became an article of the Bill\r\n",
      "of Rights then framed, that \"the raising or keeping a standing army\r\n",
      "within the kingdom in time of peace, UNLESS WITH THE CONSENT OF\r\n",

      "extended to the representatives of the people in their popular\r\n",

      "THE power of regulating the militia, and of commanding its services in\r\n",

      "of superintending the common defense, and of watching over the internal\r\n",

      "It requires no skill in the science of war to discern that uniformity\r\n",
      "in the organization and discipline of the militia would be attended with\r\n",
      "the most beneficial effects, whenever they were called into service for\r\n",
      "the public defense. It would enable them to discharge the duties of the\r\n",

      "of peculiar moment in the operations of an army; and it would fit them\r\n",
      "much sooner to acquire the degree of proficiency in military functions\r\n",
      "which would be essential to their usefulness. This desirable uniformity\r\n",
      "can only be accomplished by confiding the regulation of the militia to\r\n",
      "the direction of the national authority. It is, therefore, with the most\r\n",
      "evident propriety, that the plan of the convention proposes to empower\r\n",
      "the Union \"to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the\r\n",
      "militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the\r\n",

      "expected, or is so untenable in itself, as the one from which this\r\n",
      "particular provision has been attacked. If a well-regulated militia be\r\n",
      "the most natural defense of a free country, it ought certainly to\r\n",
      "be under the regulation and at the disposal of that body which is\r\n",
      "constituted the guardian of the national security. If standing armies\r\n",
      "are dangerous to liberty, an efficacious power over the militia, in the\r\n",
      "body to whose care the protection of the State is committed, ought, as\r\n",
      "far as possible, to take away the inducement and the pretext to such\r\n",
      "unfriendly institutions. If the federal government can command the aid\r\n",
      "of the militia in those emergencies which call for the military arm in\r\n",
      "support of the civil magistrate, it can the better dispense with the\r\n",
      "employment of a different kind of force. If it cannot avail itself of\r\n",
      "the former, it will be obliged to recur to the latter. To render an army\r\n",

      "In order to cast an odium upon the power of calling forth the militia\r\n",
      "to execute the laws of the Union, it has been remarked that there is\r\n",
      "nowhere any provision in the proposed Constitution for calling out the\r\n",
      "POSSE COMITATUS, to assist the magistrate in the execution of his duty,\r\n",
      "whence it has been inferred, that military force was intended to be his\r\n",

      "which have appeared, and sometimes even from the same quarter, not much\r\n",
      "calculated to inspire a very favorable opinion of the sincerity or fair\r\n",
      "dealing of their authors. The same persons who tell us in one breath,\r\n",
      "that the powers of the federal government will be despotic and\r\n",
      "unlimited, inform us in the next, that it has not authority sufficient\r\n",
      "even to call out the POSSE COMITATUS. The latter, fortunately, is as\r\n",
      "much short of the truth as the former exceeds it. It would be as absurd\r\n",
      "to doubt, that a right to pass all laws NECESSARY AND PROPER to execute\r\n",
      "its declared powers, would include that of requiring the assistance of\r\n",
      "the citizens to the officers who may be intrusted with the execution\r\n",
      "of those laws, as it would be to believe, that a right to enact laws\r\n",

      "involve that of varying the rules of descent and of the alienation of\r\n",
      "landed property, or of abolishing the trial by jury in cases relating to\r\n",

      "in its application to the authority of the federal government over the\r\n",
      "militia, is as uncandid as it is illogical. What reason could there\r\n",
      "be to infer, that force was intended to be the sole instrument of\r\n",

      "But so far from viewing the matter in the same light with those who\r\n",

      "were I to deliver my sentiments to a member of the federal legislature\r\n",
      "from this State on the subject of a militia establishment, I should hold\r\n",
      "to him, in substance, the following discourse:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The project of disciplining all the militia of the United States is\r\n",
      "as futile as it would be injurious, if it were capable of being carried\r\n",
      "into execution. A tolerable expertness in military movements is a\r\n",
      "business that requires time and practice. It is not a day, or even a\r\n",
      "week, that will suffice for the attainment of it. To oblige the great\r\n",
      "body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes of the citizens, to\r\n",
      "be under arms for the purpose of going through military exercises and\r\n",
      "evolutions, as often as might be necessary to acquire the degree of\r\n",
      "perfection which would entitle them to the character of a well-regulated\r\n",
      "militia, would be a real grievance to the people, and a serious public\r\n",
      "inconvenience and loss. It would form an annual deduction from the\r\n",
      "productive labor of the country, to an amount which, calculating upon\r\n",
      "the present numbers of the people, would not fall far short of the whole\r\n",
      "expense of the civil establishments of all the States. To attempt\r\n",
      "a thing which would abridge the mass of labor and industry to so\r\n",
      "considerable an extent, would be unwise: and the experiment, if made,\r\n",
      "could not succeed, because it would not long be endured. Little more\r\n",
      "can reasonably be aimed at, with respect to the people at large, than to\r\n",
      "have them properly armed and equipped; and in order to see that this be\r\n",
      "not neglected, it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in\r\n",
      "the course of a year.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But though the scheme of disciplining the whole nation must be\r\n",
      "abandoned as mischievous or impracticable; yet it is a matter of the\r\n",
      "utmost importance that a well-digested plan should, as soon as possible,\r\n",
      "be adopted for the proper establishment of the militia. The attention of\r\n",
      "the government ought particularly to be directed to the formation of a\r\n",
      "select corps of moderate extent, upon such principles as will really fit\r\n",
      "them for service in case of need. By thus circumscribing the plan, it\r\n",
      "will be possible to have an excellent body of well-trained militia,\r\n",
      "ready to take the field whenever the defense of the State shall require\r\n",
      "it. This will not only lessen the call for military establishments, but\r\n",
      "if circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an\r\n",
      "army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberties\r\n",
      "of the people while there is a large body of citizens, little, if at\r\n",
      "all, inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready\r\n",
      "to defend their own rights and those of their fellow-citizens. This\r\n",
      "appears to me the only substitute that can be devised for a standing\r\n",
      "army, and the best possible security against it, if it should exist.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus differently from the adversaries of the proposed Constitution\r\n",
      "should I reason on the same subject, deducing arguments of safety\r\n",
      "from the very sources which they represent as fraught with danger and\r\n",
      "perdition. But how the national legislature may reason on the point, is\r\n",
      "a thing which neither they nor I can foresee.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There is something so far-fetched and so extravagant in the idea of\r\n",
      "danger to liberty from the militia, that one is at a loss whether to\r\n",
      "treat it with gravity or with raillery; whether to consider it as a mere\r\n",
      "trial of skill, like the paradoxes of rhetoricians; as a disingenuous\r\n",
      "artifice to instil prejudices at any price; or as the serious offspring\r\n",
      "of political fanaticism. Where in the name of common-sense, are our\r\n",
      "fears to end if we may not trust our sons, our brothers, our neighbors,\r\n",
      "our fellow-citizens? What shadow of danger can there be from men who\r\n",
      "are daily mingling with the rest of their countrymen and who participate\r\n",
      "with them in the same feelings, sentiments, habits and interests? What\r\n",
      "reasonable cause of apprehension can be inferred from a power in the\r\n",
      "Union to prescribe regulations for the militia, and to command its\r\n",
      "services when necessary, while the particular States are to have the\r\n",
      "SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE APPOINTMENT OF THE OFFICERS? If it were possible\r\n",
      "seriously to indulge a jealousy of the militia upon any conceivable\r\n",
      "establishment under the federal government, the circumstance of the\r\n",
      "officers being in the appointment of the States ought at once to\r\n",
      "extinguish it. There can be no doubt that this circumstance will always\r\n",
      "secure to them a preponderating influence over the militia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In reading many of the publications against the Constitution, a man is\r\n",
      "apt to imagine that he is perusing some ill-written tale or romance,\r\n",

      "instance an authority to the Union, and in another prohibited the States\r\n",
      "from exercising the like authority; and where it granted an authority\r\n",

      "interferences in the POLICY of any branch of administration, but\r\n",
      "would not imply any direct contradiction or repugnancy in point of\r\n",
      "constitutional authority. These three cases of exclusive jurisdiction\r\n",
      "in the federal government may be exemplified by the following instances:\r\n",
      "The last clause but one in the eighth section of the first article\r\n",
      "provides expressly that Congress shall exercise \"EXCLUSIVE LEGISLATION\"\r\n",
      "over the district to be appropriated as the seat of government. This\r\n",
      "answers to the first case. The first clause of the same section empowers\r\n",
      "Congress \"to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises\"; and\r\n",
      "the second clause of the tenth section of the same article declares\r\n",
      "that, \"NO STATE SHALL, without the consent of Congress, lay any imposts\r\n",
      "or duties on imports or exports, except for the purpose of executing its\r\n",
      "inspection laws.\" Hence would result an exclusive power in the Union\r\n",
      "to lay duties on imports and exports, with the particular exception\r\n",
      "mentioned; but this power is abridged by another clause, which declares\r\n",
      "that no tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any State;\r\n",
      "in consequence of which qualification, it now only extends to the DUTIES\r\n",
      "ON IMPORTS. This answers to the second case. The third will be found in\r\n",
      "that clause which declares that Congress shall have power \"to establish\r\n",
      "an UNIFORM RULE of naturalization throughout the United States.\" This\r\n",
      "must necessarily be exclusive; because if each State had power to\r\n",
      "prescribe a DISTINCT RULE, there could not be a UNIFORM RULE.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A case which may perhaps be thought to resemble the latter, but which\r\n",
      "is in fact widely different, affects the question immediately under\r\n",

      "than exports and imports. This, I contend, is manifestly a concurrent\r\n",
      "and coequal authority in the United States and in the individual States.\r\n",

      "the case, that a plain and conclusive argument to the contrary is to be\r\n",
      "deduced from the restraint laid upon the States in relation to duties on\r\n",
      "imports and exports. This restriction implies an admission that, if it\r\n",
      "were not inserted, the States would possess the power it excludes;\r\n",
      "and it implies a further admission, that as to all other taxes, the\r\n",
      "authority of the States remains undiminished. In any other view it would\r\n",
      "be both unnecessary and dangerous; it would be unnecessary, because if\r\n",
      "the grant to the Union of the power of laying such duties implied the\r\n",
      "exclusion of the States, or even their subordination in this particular,\r\n",
      "there could be no need of such a restriction; it would be dangerous,\r\n",
      "because the introduction of it leads directly to the conclusion which\r\n",
      "has been mentioned, and which, if the reasoning of the objectors be\r\n",
      "just, could not have been intended; I mean that the States, in all cases\r\n",
      "to which the restriction did not apply, would have a concurrent power\r\n",
      "of taxation with the Union. The restriction in question amounts to what\r\n",
      "lawyers call a NEGATIVE PREGNANT that is, a NEGATION of one thing, and\r\n",
      "an AFFIRMANCE of another; a negation of the authority of the States\r\n",
      "to impose taxes on imports and exports, and an affirmance of their\r\n",
      "authority to impose them on all other articles. It would be mere\r\n",
      "sophistry to argue that it was meant to exclude them ABSOLUTELY from the\r\n",
      "imposition of taxes of the former kind, and to leave them at liberty\r\n",
      "to lay others SUBJECT TO THE CONTROL of the national legislature.\r\n",

      "WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF CONGRESS, lay such duties; and if we are to\r\n",
      "understand this in the sense last mentioned, the Constitution would then\r\n",

      "BEFORE we proceed to examine any other objections to an indefinite power\r\n",
      "of taxation in the Union, I shall make one general remark; which is,\r\n",
      "that if the jurisdiction of the national government, in the article of\r\n",
      "revenue, should be restricted to particular objects, it would naturally\r\n",
      "occasion an undue proportion of the public burdens to fall upon those\r\n",
      "objects. Two evils would spring from this source: the oppression of\r\n",
      "particular branches of industry; and an unequal distribution of the\r\n",
      "taxes, as well among the several States as among the citizens of the\r\n",
      "same State.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Suppose, as has been contended for, the federal power of taxation were\r\n",
      "to be confined to duties on imports, it is evident that the government,\r\n",
      "for want of being able to command other resources, would frequently be\r\n",
      "tempted to extend these duties to an injurious excess. There are persons\r\n",
      "who imagine that they can never be carried to too great a length; since\r\n",
      "the higher they are, the more it is alleged they will tend to discourage\r\n",
      "an extravagant consumption, to produce a favorable balance of trade,\r\n",
      "and to promote domestic manufactures. But all extremes are pernicious\r\n",
      "in various ways. Exorbitant duties on imported articles would beget a\r\n",
      "general spirit of smuggling; which is always prejudicial to the fair\r\n",
      "trader, and eventually to the revenue itself: they tend to render\r\n",
      "other classes of the community tributary, in an improper degree, to the\r\n",
      "manufacturing classes, to whom they give a premature monopoly of the\r\n",
      "markets; they sometimes force industry out of its more natural channels\r\n",
      "into others in which it flows with less advantage; and in the last\r\n",
      "place, they oppress the merchant, who is often obliged to pay them\r\n",
      "himself without any retribution from the consumer. When the demand is\r\n",
      "equal to the quantity of goods at market, the consumer generally\r\n",
      "pays the duty; but when the markets happen to be overstocked, a great\r\n",
      "proportion falls upon the merchant, and sometimes not only exhausts\r\n",
      "his profits, but breaks in upon his capital. I am apt to think that\r\n",
      "a division of the duty, between the seller and the buyer, more often\r\n",
      "happens than is commonly imagined. It is not always possible to raise\r\n",
      "the price of a commodity in exact proportion to every additional\r\n",
      "imposition laid upon it. The merchant, especially in a country of small\r\n",
      "commercial capital, is often under a necessity of keeping prices down in\r\n",
      "order to a more expeditious sale.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The maxim that the consumer is the payer, is so much oftener true than\r\n",
      "the reverse of the proposition, that it is far more equitable that the\r\n",
      "duties on imports should go into a common stock, than that they should\r\n",
      "redound to the exclusive benefit of the importing States. But it is not\r\n",
      "so generally true as to render it equitable, that those duties should\r\n",
      "form the only national fund. When they are paid by the merchant they\r\n",
      "operate as an additional tax upon the importing State, whose citizens\r\n",
      "pay their proportion of them in the character of consumers. In this view\r\n",
      "they are productive of inequality among the States; which inequality\r\n",
      "would be increased with the increased extent of the duties. The\r\n",
      "confinement of the national revenues to this species of imposts would\r\n",
      "be attended with inequality, from a different cause, between the\r\n",
      "manufacturing and the non-manufacturing States. The States which can\r\n",
      "go farthest towards the supply of their own wants, by their own\r\n",
      "manufactures, will not, according to their numbers or wealth, consume so\r\n",
      "great a proportion of imported articles as those States which are not\r\n",
      "in the same favorable situation. They would not, therefore, in this mode\r\n",
      "alone contribute to the public treasury in a ratio to their abilities.\r\n",
      "To make them do this it is necessary that recourse be had to excises,\r\n",
      "the proper objects of which are particular kinds of manufactures. New\r\n",
      "York is more deeply interested in these considerations than such of\r\n",
      "her citizens as contend for limiting the power of the Union to external\r\n",
      "taxation may be aware of. New York is an importing State, and is not\r\n",

      "be a consequence of the limitation of the federal power of taxation, the\r\n",
      "inequalities spoken of would still ensue, though not in the same degree,\r\n",

      "sufficiently numerous for the reception of all the different classes of\r\n",
      "citizens, in order to combine the interests and feelings of every\r\n",
      "part of the community, and to produce a due sympathy between the\r\n",

      "in the first place, impracticable, and in the sense in which it\r\n",
      "is contended for, is unnecessary. I reserve for another place the\r\n",
      "discussion of the question which relates to the sufficiency of the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The idea of an actual representation of all classes of the people, by\r\n",

      "provided in the Constitution, that each different occupation should\r\n",
      "send one or more members, the thing would never take place in\r\n",
      "practice. Mechanics and manufacturers will always be inclined, with few\r\n",
      "exceptions, to give their votes to merchants, in preference to persons\r\n",
      "of their own professions or trades. Those discerning citizens are well\r\n",
      "aware that the mechanic and manufacturing arts furnish the materials\r\n",
      "of mercantile enterprise and industry. Many of them, indeed, are\r\n",
      "immediately connected with the operations of commerce. They know that\r\n",

      "that however great the confidence they may justly feel in their own good\r\n",

      "most part useless; and that the influence and weight, and superior\r\n",

      "councils, unfriendly to the manufacturing and trading interests. These\r\n",
      "considerations, and many others that might be mentioned prove, and\r\n",
      "experience confirms it, that artisans and manufacturers will commonly\r\n",
      "be disposed to bestow their votes upon merchants and those whom\r\n",

      "our attention. It has been asserted that a power of internal taxation\r\n",
      "in the national legislature could never be exercised with advantage, as\r\n",
      "well from the want of a sufficient knowledge of local circumstances, as\r\n",
      "from an interference between the revenue laws of the Union and of the\r\n",
      "particular States. The supposition of a want of proper knowledge seems\r\n",
      "to be entirely destitute of foundation. If any question is depending\r\n",
      "in a State legislature respecting one of the counties, which demands\r\n",
      "a knowledge of local details, how is it acquired? No doubt from the\r\n",
      "information of the members of the county. Cannot the like knowledge be\r\n",
      "obtained in the national legislature from the representatives of each\r\n",
      "State? And is it not to be presumed that the men who will generally be\r\n",
      "sent there will be possessed of the necessary degree of intelligence\r\n",
      "to be able to communicate that information? Is the knowledge of\r\n",
      "local circumstances, as applied to taxation, a minute topographical\r\n",
      "acquaintance with all the mountains, rivers, streams, highways,\r\n",
      "and bypaths in each State; or is it a general acquaintance with its\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Nations in general, even under governments of the more popular kind,\r\n",
      "usually commit the administration of their finances to single men or\r\n",
      "to boards composed of a few individuals, who digest and prepare, in the\r\n",

      "circumstances requisite to the purposes of taxation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The taxes intended to be comprised under the general denomination of\r\n",
      "internal taxes may be subdivided into those of the DIRECT and those\r\n",
      "of the INDIRECT kind. Though the objection be made to both, yet the\r\n",
      "reasoning upon it seems to be confined to the former branch. And indeed,\r\n",
      "as to the latter, by which must be understood duties and excises on\r\n",
      "articles of consumption, one is at a loss to conceive what can be the\r\n",
      "nature of the difficulties apprehended. The knowledge relating to them\r\n",
      "must evidently be of a kind that will either be suggested by the nature\r\n",
      "of the article itself, or can easily be procured from any well-informed\r\n",
      "man, especially of the mercantile class. The circumstances that may\r\n",
      "distinguish its situation in one State from its situation in another\r\n",
      "must be few, simple, and easy to be comprehended. The principal thing\r\n",
      "to be attended to, would be to avoid those articles which had been\r\n",
      "previously appropriated to the use of a particular State; and there\r\n",
      "could be no difficulty in ascertaining the revenue system of each. This\r\n",
      "could always be known from the respective codes of laws, as well as from\r\n",
      "the information of the members from the several States.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The objection, when applied to real property or to houses and lands,\r\n",
      "appears to have, at first sight, more foundation, but even in this view\r\n",
      "it will not bear a close examination. Land taxes are commonly laid in\r\n",
      "one of two modes, either by ACTUAL valuations, permanent or periodical,\r\n",
      "or by OCCASIONAL assessments, at the discretion, or according to the\r\n",
      "best judgment, of certain officers whose duty it is to make them. In\r\n",
      "either case, the EXECUTION of the business, which alone requires the\r\n",
      "knowledge of local details, must be devolved upon discreet persons in\r\n",
      "the character of commissioners or assessors, elected by the people or\r\n",
      "appointed by the government for the purpose. All that the law can do\r\n",
      "must be to name the persons or to prescribe the manner of their election\r\n",
      "or appointment, to fix their numbers and qualifications and to draw the\r\n",
      "general outlines of their powers and duties. And what is there in all\r\n",
      "this that cannot as well be performed by the national legislature as by\r\n",
      "a State legislature? The attention of either can only reach to general\r\n",
      "principles; local details, as already observed, must be referred to\r\n",
      "those who are to execute the plan.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But there is a simple point of view in which this matter may be placed\r\n",
      "that must be altogether satisfactory. The national legislature can make\r\n",
      "use of the SYSTEM OF EACH STATE WITHIN THAT STATE. The method of laying\r\n",
      "and collecting this species of taxes in each State can, in all its\r\n",
      "parts, be adopted and employed by the federal government.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Let it be recollected that the proportion of these taxes is not to\r\n",
      "be left to the discretion of the national legislature, but is to be\r\n",
      "determined by the numbers of each State, as described in the second\r\n",
      "section of the first article. An actual census or enumeration of the\r\n",
      "people must furnish the rule, a circumstance which effectually shuts the\r\n",
      "door to partiality or oppression. The abuse of this power of taxation\r\n",
      "seems to have been provided against with guarded circumspection. In\r\n",
      "addition to the precaution just mentioned, there is a provision that\r\n",
      "\"all duties, imposts, and excises shall be UNIFORM throughout the United\r\n",
      "States.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It has been very properly observed by different speakers and writers\r\n",
      "on the side of the Constitution, that if the exercise of the power of\r\n",
      "internal taxation by the Union should be discovered on experiment to be\r\n",
      "really inconvenient, the federal government may then forbear the use of\r\n",
      "it, and have recourse to requisitions in its stead. By way of answer to\r\n",
      "this, it has been triumphantly asked, Why not in the first instance\r\n",
      "omit that ambiguous power, and rely upon the latter resource? Two solid\r\n",
      "answers may be given. The first is, that the exercise of that power, if\r\n",
      "convenient, will be preferable, because it will be more effectual;\r\n",
      "and it is impossible to prove in theory, or otherwise than by the\r\n",
      "experiment, that it cannot be advantageously exercised. The contrary,\r\n",
      "indeed, appears most probable. The second answer is, that the existence\r\n",
      "of such a power in the Constitution will have a strong influence in\r\n",
      "giving efficacy to requisitions. When the States know that the Union\r\n",
      "can apply itself without their agency, it will be a powerful motive for\r\n",
      "exertion on their part.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As to the interference of the revenue laws of the Union, and of\r\n",
      "its members, we have already seen that there can be no clashing or\r\n",
      "repugnancy of authority. The laws cannot, therefore, in a legal sense,\r\n",
      "interfere with each other; and it is far from impossible to avoid an\r\n",
      "interference even in the policy of their different systems. An effectual\r\n",
      "expedient for this purpose will be, mutually, to abstain from those\r\n",
      "objects which either side may have first had recourse to. As neither can\r\n",
      "CONTROL the other, each will have an obvious and sensible interest in\r\n",
      "this reciprocal forbearance. And where there is an IMMEDIATE common\r\n",
      "interest, we may safely count upon its operation. When the particular\r\n",
      "debts of the States are done away, and their expenses come to be limited\r\n",
      "within their natural compass, the possibility almost of interference\r\n",
      "will vanish. A small land tax will answer the purpose of the States, and\r\n",
      "will be their most simple and most fit resource.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Many spectres have been raised out of this power of internal taxation,\r\n",
      "to excite the apprehensions of the people: double sets of revenue\r\n",
      "officers, a duplication of their burdens by double taxations, and the\r\n",
      "frightful forms of odious and oppressive poll-taxes, have been played\r\n",
      "off with all the ingenious dexterity of political legerdemain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As to the first point, there are two cases in which there can be no room\r\n",
      "for double sets of officers: one, where the right of imposing the tax is\r\n",
      "exclusively vested in the Union, which applies to the duties on imports;\r\n",
      "the other, where the object has not fallen under any State regulation\r\n",
      "or provision, which may be applicable to a variety of objects. In other\r\n",
      "cases, the probability is that the United States will either wholly\r\n",
      "abstain from the objects preoccupied for local purposes, or will make\r\n",
      "use of the State officers and State regulations for collecting the\r\n",
      "additional imposition. This will best answer the views of revenue,\r\n",
      "because it will save expense in the collection, and will best avoid any\r\n",
      "occasion of disgust to the State governments and to the people. At\r\n",
      "all events, here is a practicable expedient for avoiding such an\r\n",
      "inconvenience; and nothing more can be required than to show that evils\r\n",
      "predicted to not necessarily result from the plan.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As to any argument derived from a supposed system of influence, it is\r\n",
      "a sufficient answer to say that it ought not to be presumed; but the\r\n",
      "supposition is susceptible of a more precise answer. If such a spirit\r\n",
      "should infest the councils of the Union, the most certain road to the\r\n",
      "accomplishment of its aim would be to employ the State officers as much\r\n",
      "as possible, and to attach them to the Union by an accumulation of their\r\n",
      "emoluments. This would serve to turn the tide of State influence into\r\n",
      "the channels of the national government, instead of making federal\r\n",
      "influence flow in an opposite and adverse current. But all suppositions\r\n",
      "of this kind are invidious, and ought to be banished from the\r\n",
      "consideration of the great question before the people. They can answer\r\n",
      "no other end than to cast a mist over the truth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As to the suggestion of double taxation, the answer is plain. The wants\r\n",
      "of the Union are to be supplied in one way or another; if to be done by\r\n",
      "the authority of the federal government, it will not be to be done by\r\n",
      "that of the State government. The quantity of taxes to be paid by the\r\n",
      "community must be the same in either case; with this advantage, if\r\n",
      "the provision is to be made by the Union that the capital resource of\r\n",
      "commercial imposts, which is the most convenient branch of revenue, can\r\n",
      "be prudently improved to a much greater extent under federal than under\r\n",
      "State regulation, and of course will render it less necessary to recur\r\n",
      "to more inconvenient methods; and with this further advantage, that as\r\n",
      "far as there may be any real difficulty in the exercise of the power of\r\n",
      "internal taxation, it will impose a disposition to greater care in the\r\n",
      "choice and arrangement of the means; and must naturally tend to make it\r\n",
      "a fixed point of policy in the national administration to go as far as\r\n",
      "may be practicable in making the luxury of the rich tributary to the\r\n",
      "public treasury, in order to diminish the necessity of those impositions\r\n",
      "which might create dissatisfaction in the poorer and most numerous\r\n",
      "classes of the society. Happy it is when the interest which the\r\n",
      "government has in the preservation of its own power, coincides with a\r\n",
      "proper distribution of the public burdens, and tends to guard the least\r\n",
      "wealthy part of the community from oppression!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As to poll taxes, I, without scruple, confess my disapprobation of them;\r\n",
      "and though they have prevailed from an early period in those States(1)\r\n",
      "which have uniformly been the most tenacious of their rights, I\r\n",
      "should lament to see them introduced into practice under the national\r\n",
      "government. But does it follow because there is a power to lay them that\r\n",
      "they will actually be laid? Every State in the Union has power to impose\r\n",
      "taxes of this kind; and yet in several of them they are unknown in\r\n",
      "practice. Are the State governments to be stigmatized as tyrannies,\r\n",
      "because they possess this power? If they are not, with what propriety\r\n",
      "can the like power justify such a charge against the national\r\n",
      "government, or even be urged as an obstacle to its adoption? As little\r\n",
      "friendly as I am to the species of imposition, I still feel a thorough\r\n",
      "conviction that the power of having recourse to it ought to exist in the\r\n",
      "federal government. There are certain emergencies of nations, in which\r\n",
      "expedients, that in the ordinary state of things ought to be forborne,\r\n",
      "become essential to the public weal. And the government, from the\r\n",
      "possibility of such emergencies, ought ever to have the option of making\r\n",
      "use of them. The real scarcity of objects in this country, which may\r\n",
      "be considered as productive sources of revenue, is a reason peculiar\r\n",
      "to itself, for not abridging the discretion of the national councils\r\n",
      "in this respect. There may exist certain critical and tempestuous\r\n",
      "conjunctures of the State, in which a poll tax may become an inestimable\r\n",
      "resource. And as I know nothing to exempt this portion of the globe\r\n",
      "from the common calamities that have befallen other parts of it, I\r\n",
      "acknowledge my aversion to every project that is calculated to disarm\r\n",
      "the government of a single weapon, which in any possible contingency\r\n",
      "might be usefully employed for the general defense and security.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "(I have now gone through the examination of such of the powers proposed\r\n",
      "to be vested in the United States, which may be considered as having an\r\n",
      "immediate relation to the energy of the government; and have endeavored\r\n",
      "to answer the principal objections which have been made to them. I have\r\n",
      "passed over in silence those minor authorities, which are either too\r\n",
      "inconsiderable to have been thought worthy of the hostilities of the\r\n",
      "opponents of the Constitution, or of too manifest propriety to admit of\r\n",

      "which may be viewed in so many lights and relations, and which touches\r\n",
      "the springs of so many passions and interests, should find or excite\r\n",
      "dispositions unfriendly, both on one side and on the other, to a fair\r\n",
      "discussion and accurate judgment of its merits. In some, it has been too\r\n",

      "predetermination to condemn; as the language held by others betrays an\r\n",
      "opposite predetermination or bias, which must render their opinions also\r\n",

      "they may on the contrary be culpable. The views of the last cannot be\r\n",
      "upright, and must be culpable. But the truth is, that these papers are\r\n",
      "not addressed to persons falling under either of these characters. They\r\n",
      "solicit the attention of those only, who add to a sincere zeal for the\r\n",
      "happiness of their country, a temper favorable to a just estimate of the\r\n",
      "means of promoting it.\r\n",

      "Persons of this character will proceed to an examination of the plan\r\n",
      "submitted by the convention, not only without a disposition to find\r\n",
      "or to magnify faults; but will see the propriety of reflecting, that\r\n",
      "a faultless plan was not to be expected. Nor will they barely make\r\n",
      "allowances for the errors which may be chargeable on the fallibility to\r\n",
      "which the convention, as a body of men, were liable; but will keep in\r\n",
      "mind, that they themselves also are but men, and ought not to assume an\r\n",
      "infallibility in rejudging the fallible opinions of others.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With equal readiness will it be perceived, that besides these\r\n",
      "inducements to candor, many allowances ought to be made for the\r\n",
      "difficulties inherent in the very nature of the undertaking referred to\r\n",
      "the convention.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The novelty of the undertaking immediately strikes us. It has been\r\n",
      "shown in the course of these papers, that the existing Confederation is\r\n",
      "founded on principles which are fallacious; that we must consequently\r\n",
      "change this first foundation, and with it the superstructure resting\r\n",
      "upon it. It has been shown, that the other confederacies which could\r\n",
      "be consulted as precedents have been vitiated by the same erroneous\r\n",
      "principles, and can therefore furnish no other light than that of\r\n",
      "beacons, which give warning of the course to be shunned, without\r\n",
      "pointing out that which ought to be pursued. The most that the\r\n",
      "convention could do in such a situation, was to avoid the errors\r\n",
      "suggested by the past experience of other countries, as well as of our\r\n",
      "own; and to provide a convenient mode of rectifying their own errors, as\r\n",
      "future experiences may unfold them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Among the difficulties encountered by the convention, a very important\r\n",
      "one must have lain in combining the requisite stability and energy in\r\n",
      "government, with the inviolable attention due to liberty and to the\r\n",
      "republican form. Without substantially accomplishing this part of their\r\n",
      "undertaking, they would have very imperfectly fulfilled the object of\r\n",
      "their appointment, or the expectation of the public; yet that it could\r\n",
      "not be easily accomplished, will be denied by no one who is unwilling to\r\n",
      "betray his ignorance of the subject. Energy in government is essential\r\n",
      "to that security against external and internal danger, and to that\r\n",
      "prompt and salutary execution of the laws which enter into the very\r\n",
      "definition of good government. Stability in government is essential to\r\n",
      "national character and to the advantages annexed to it, as well as to\r\n",
      "that repose and confidence in the minds of the people, which are\r\n",
      "among the chief blessings of civil society. An irregular and mutable\r\n",
      "legislation is not more an evil in itself than it is odious to the\r\n",
      "people; and it may be pronounced with assurance that the people of\r\n",
      "this country, enlightened as they are with regard to the nature, and\r\n",
      "interested, as the great body of them are, in the effects of good\r\n",
      "government, will never be satisfied till some remedy be applied to\r\n",
      "the vicissitudes and uncertainties which characterize the State\r\n",
      "administrations. On comparing, however, these valuable ingredients with\r\n",
      "the vital principles of liberty, we must perceive at once the difficulty\r\n",
      "of mingling them together in their due proportions. The genius of\r\n",
      "republican liberty seems to demand on one side, not only that all power\r\n",
      "should be derived from the people, but that those intrusted with it\r\n",
      "should be kept in independence on the people, by a short duration of\r\n",
      "their appointments; and that even during this short period the trust\r\n",
      "should be placed not in a few, but a number of hands. Stability, on\r\n",
      "the contrary, requires that the hands in which power is lodged should\r\n",
      "continue for a length of time the same. A frequent change of men will\r\n",
      "result from a frequent return of elections; and a frequent change of\r\n",
      "measures from a frequent change of men: whilst energy in government\r\n",
      "requires not only a certain duration of power, but the execution of it\r\n",
      "by a single hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How far the convention may have succeeded in this part of their work,\r\n",
      "will better appear on a more accurate view of it. From the cursory view\r\n",
      "here taken, it must clearly appear to have been an arduous part.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Not less arduous must have been the task of marking the proper line of\r\n",
      "partition between the authority of the general and that of the\r\n",
      "State governments. Every man will be sensible of this difficulty, in\r\n",
      "proportion as he has been accustomed to contemplate and discriminate\r\n",
      "objects extensive and complicated in their nature. The faculties of\r\n",
      "the mind itself have never yet been distinguished and defined, with\r\n",
      "satisfactory precision, by all the efforts of the most acute and\r\n",
      "metaphysical philosophers. Sense, perception, judgment, desire,\r\n",
      "volition, memory, imagination, are found to be separated by such\r\n",
      "delicate shades and minute gradations that their boundaries have\r\n",
      "eluded the most subtle investigations, and remain a pregnant source of\r\n",
      "ingenious disquisition and controversy. The boundaries between the great\r\n",
      "kingdom of nature, and, still more, between the various provinces,\r\n",
      "and lesser portions, into which they are subdivided, afford another\r\n",
      "illustration of the same important truth. The most sagacious and\r\n",
      "laborious naturalists have never yet succeeded in tracing with certainty\r\n",
      "the line which separates the district of vegetable life from the\r\n",
      "neighboring region of unorganized matter, or which marks the termination\r\n",
      "of the former and the commencement of the animal empire. A still greater\r\n",
      "obscurity lies in the distinctive characters by which the objects\r\n",
      "in each of these great departments of nature have been arranged and\r\n",
      "assorted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When we pass from the works of nature, in which all the delineations\r\n",
      "are perfectly accurate, and appear to be otherwise only from the\r\n",
      "imperfection of the eye which surveys them, to the institutions of man,\r\n",
      "in which the obscurity arises as well from the object itself as from\r\n",
      "the organ by which it is contemplated, we must perceive the necessity of\r\n",
      "moderating still further our expectations and hopes from the efforts\r\n",
      "of human sagacity. Experience has instructed us that no skill in the\r\n",
      "science of government has yet been able to discriminate and define,\r\n",
      "with sufficient certainty, its three great provinces the legislative,\r\n",
      "executive, and judiciary; or even the privileges and powers of the\r\n",
      "different legislative branches. Questions daily occur in the course of\r\n",
      "practice, which prove the obscurity which reins in these subjects, and\r\n",
      "which puzzle the greatest adepts in political science.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The experience of ages, with the continued and combined labors of the\r\n",
      "most enlightened legislatures and jurists, has been equally unsuccessful\r\n",
      "in delineating the several objects and limits of different codes of laws\r\n",
      "and different tribunals of justice. The precise extent of the common\r\n",
      "law, and the statute law, the maritime law, the ecclesiastical law, the\r\n",
      "law of corporations, and other local laws and customs, remains still to\r\n",
      "be clearly and finally established in Great Britain, where accuracy in\r\n",
      "such subjects has been more industriously pursued than in any other part\r\n",
      "of the world. The jurisdiction of her several courts, general and local,\r\n",
      "of law, of equity, of admiralty, etc., is not less a source of frequent\r\n",
      "and intricate discussions, sufficiently denoting the indeterminate\r\n",
      "limits by which they are respectively circumscribed. All new laws,\r\n",
      "though penned with the greatest technical skill, and passed on the\r\n",
      "fullest and most mature deliberation, are considered as more or less\r\n",
      "obscure and equivocal, until their meaning be liquidated and ascertained\r\n",
      "by a series of particular discussions and adjudications. Besides the\r\n",
      "obscurity arising from the complexity of objects, and the imperfection\r\n",
      "of the human faculties, the medium through which the conceptions of men\r\n",
      "are conveyed to each other adds a fresh embarrassment. The use of words\r\n",
      "is to express ideas. Perspicuity, therefore, requires not only that the\r\n",
      "ideas should be distinctly formed, but that they should be expressed by\r\n",
      "words distinctly and exclusively appropriate to them. But no language is\r\n",
      "so copious as to supply words and phrases for every complex idea, or\r\n",
      "so correct as not to include many equivocally denoting different\r\n",
      "ideas. Hence it must happen that however accurately objects may be\r\n",
      "discriminated in themselves, and however accurately the discrimination\r\n",
      "may be considered, the definition of them may be rendered inaccurate\r\n",
      "by the inaccuracy of the terms in which it is delivered. And this\r\n",
      "unavoidable inaccuracy must be greater or less, according to the\r\n",
      "complexity and novelty of the objects defined. When the Almighty himself\r\n",
      "condescends to address mankind in their own language, his meaning,\r\n",
      "luminous as it must be, is rendered dim and doubtful by the cloudy\r\n",
      "medium through which it is communicated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here, then, are three sources of vague and incorrect definitions:\r\n",
      "indistinctness of the object, imperfection of the organ of conception,\r\n",
      "inadequateness of the vehicle of ideas. Any one of these must produce a\r\n",
      "certain degree of obscurity. The convention, in delineating the boundary\r\n",
      "between the federal and State jurisdictions, must have experienced the\r\n",
      "full effect of them all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To the difficulties already mentioned may be added the interfering\r\n",
      "pretensions of the larger and smaller States. We cannot err in supposing\r\n",
      "that the former would contend for a participation in the government,\r\n",
      "fully proportioned to their superior wealth and importance; and that the\r\n",
      "latter would not be less tenacious of the equality at present enjoyed by\r\n",
      "them. We may well suppose that neither side would entirely yield to the\r\n",
      "other, and consequently that the struggle could be terminated only by\r\n",
      "compromise. It is extremely probable, also, that after the ratio\r\n",
      "of representation had been adjusted, this very compromise must have\r\n",
      "produced a fresh struggle between the same parties, to give such a turn\r\n",
      "to the organization of the government, and to the distribution of its\r\n",
      "powers, as would increase the importance of the branches, in forming\r\n",
      "which they had respectively obtained the greatest share of influence.\r\n",
      "There are features in the Constitution which warrant each of these\r\n",
      "suppositions; and as far as either of them is well founded, it shows\r\n",
      "that the convention must have been compelled to sacrifice theoretical\r\n",
      "propriety to the force of extraneous considerations.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nor could it have been the large and small States only, which would\r\n",
      "marshal themselves in opposition to each other on various points. Other\r\n",
      "combinations, resulting from a difference of local position and policy,\r\n",
      "must have created additional difficulties. As every State may be divided\r\n",
      "into different districts, and its citizens into different classes,\r\n",
      "which give birth to contending interests and local jealousies, so the\r\n",
      "different parts of the United States are distinguished from each other\r\n",
      "by a variety of circumstances, which produce a like effect on a larger\r\n",
      "scale. And although this variety of interests, for reasons sufficiently\r\n",
      "explained in a former paper, may have a salutary influence on the\r\n",
      "administration of the government when formed, yet every one must be\r\n",
      "sensible of the contrary influence, which must have been experienced in\r\n",
      "the task of forming it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Would it be wonderful if, under the pressure of all these difficulties,\r\n",
      "the convention should have been forced into some deviations from that\r\n",
      "artificial structure and regular symmetry which an abstract view of the\r\n",
      "subject might lead an ingenious theorist to bestow on a Constitution\r\n",
      "planned in his closet or in his imagination? The real wonder is that\r\n",
      "so many difficulties should have been surmounted, and surmounted with a\r\n",
      "unanimity almost as unprecedented as it must have been unexpected. It is\r\n",
      "impossible for any man of candor to reflect on this circumstance without\r\n",
      "partaking of the astonishment. It is impossible for the man of pious\r\n",

      "history of almost all the great councils and consultations held among\r\n",

      "mutual jealousies, and adjusting their respective interests, is a\r\n",
      "history of factions, contentions, and disappointments, and may be\r\n",
      "classed among the most dark and degraded pictures which display the\r\n",
      "infirmities and depravities of the human character. If, in a few\r\n",

      "darken the gloom of the adverse prospect to which they are contrasted.\r\n",
      "In revolving the causes from which these exceptions result, and applying\r\n",
      "them to the particular instances before us, we are necessarily led to\r\n",
      "two important conclusions. The first is, that the convention must have\r\n",
      "enjoyed, in a very singular degree, an exemption from the pestilential\r\n",
      "influence of party animosities the disease most incident to deliberative\r\n",
      "bodies, and most apt to contaminate their proceedings. The second\r\n",
      "conclusion is that all the deputations composing the convention were\r\n",
      "satisfactorily accommodated by the final act, or were induced to accede\r\n",
      "to it by a deep conviction of the necessity of sacrificing private\r\n",
      "opinions and partial interests to the public good, and by a despair of\r\n",

      "a shadow of a representation, and that the government would be far less\r\n",
      "objectionable if the number and the expense were doubled. A patriot in\r\n",

      "bias towards either of these dangers, that the weight on that side\r\n",
      "will not be sufficient to keep it upright and firm against its opposite\r\n",
      "propensities. With another class of adversaries to the Constitution the\r\n",
      "language is that the legislative, executive, and judiciary departments\r\n",
      "are intermixed in such a manner as to contradict all the ideas of\r\n",
      "regular government and all the requisite precautions in favor of\r\n",

      "expressions, there are but a few who lend their sanction to it. Let each\r\n",
      "one come forward with his particular explanation, and scarce any two are\r\n",
      "exactly agreed upon the subject. In the eyes of one the junction of the\r\n",
      "Senate with the President in the responsible function of appointing to\r\n",
      "offices, instead of vesting this executive power in the Executive alone,\r\n",
      "is the vicious part of the organization. To another, the exclusion\r\n",
      "of the House of Representatives, whose numbers alone could be a due\r\n",
      "security against corruption and partiality in the exercise of such\r\n",

      "impeachments by the Senate, which is alternately a member both of the\r\n",
      "legislative and executive departments, when this power so evidently\r\n",
      "belonged to the judiciary department. \"We concur fully,\" reply others,\r\n",
      "\"in the objection to this part of the plan, but we can never agree\r\n",
      "that a reference of impeachments to the judiciary authority would be an\r\n",
      "amendment of the error. Our principal dislike to the organization arises\r\n",
      "from the extensive powers already lodged in that department.\" Even\r\n",
      "among the zealous patrons of a council of state the most irreconcilable\r\n",
      "variance is discovered concerning the mode in which it ought to be\r\n",
      "constituted. The demand of one gentleman is, that the council should\r\n",
      "consist of a small number to be appointed by the most numerous branch of\r\n",

      "accordingly proceed to form them into a second convention, with full\r\n",

      "work of the first. Were the experiment to be seriously made, though it\r\n",
      "required some effort to view it seriously even in fiction, I leave it to\r\n",
      "be decided by the sample of opinions just exhibited, whether, with all\r\n",
      "their enmity to their predecessors, they would, in any one point, depart\r\n",
      "so widely from their example, as in the discord and ferment that would\r\n",
      "mark their own deliberations; and whether the Constitution, now before\r\n",
      "the public, would not stand as fair a chance for immortality, as\r\n",
      "Lycurgus gave to that of Sparta, by making its change to depend on his\r\n",

      "should be agreed upon by this new assembly of lawgivers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is a matter both of wonder and regret, that those who raise so many\r\n",
      "objections against the new Constitution should never call to mind the\r\n",
      "defects of that which is to be exchanged for it. It is not necessary\r\n",
      "that the former should be perfect; it is sufficient that the latter is\r\n",
      "more imperfect. No man would refuse to give brass for silver or gold,\r\n",
      "because the latter had some alloy in it. No man would refuse to quit a\r\n",
      "shattered and tottering habitation for a firm and commodious building,\r\n",
      "because the latter had not a porch to it, or because some of the rooms\r\n",
      "might be a little larger or smaller, or the ceilings a little higher or\r\n",
      "lower than his fancy would have planned them. But waiving illustrations\r\n",
      "of this sort, is it not manifest that most of the capital objections\r\n",
      "urged against the new system lie with tenfold weight against the\r\n",
      "existing Confederation? Is an indefinite power to raise money dangerous\r\n",
      "in the hands of the federal government? The present Congress can\r\n",
      "make requisitions to any amount they please, and the States are\r\n",
      "constitutionally bound to furnish them; they can emit bills of credit as\r\n",
      "long as they will pay for the paper; they can borrow, both abroad and\r\n",
      "at home, as long as a shilling will be lent. Is an indefinite power to\r\n",
      "raise troops dangerous? The Confederation gives to Congress that power\r\n",
      "also; and they have already begun to make use of it. Is it improper and\r\n",
      "unsafe to intermix the different powers of government in the same body\r\n",
      "of men? Congress, a single body of men, are the sole depositary of all\r\n",
      "the federal powers. Is it particularly dangerous to give the keys of\r\n",
      "the treasury, and the command of the army, into the same hands? The\r\n",
      "Confederation places them both in the hands of Congress. Is a bill of\r\n",
      "rights essential to liberty? The Confederation has no bill of rights.\r\n",
      "Is it an objection against the new Constitution, that it empowers the\r\n",
      "Senate, with the concurrence of the Executive, to make treaties which\r\n",
      "are to be the laws of the land? The existing Congress, without any such\r\n",
      "control, can make treaties which they themselves have declared, and most\r\n",
      "of the States have recognized, to be the supreme law of the land. Is\r\n",
      "the importation of slaves permitted by the new Constitution for twenty\r\n",
      "years? By the old it is permitted forever.\r\n",

      "State for the means of carrying them into practice; that however large\r\n",
      "the mass of powers may be, it is in fact a lifeless mass. Then, say I,\r\n",
      "in the first place, that the Confederation is chargeable with the still\r\n",
      "greater folly of declaring certain powers in the federal government to\r\n",
      "be absolutely necessary, and at the same time rendering them absolutely\r\n",

      "granted to, or assumed by, the existing Congress; in either of which\r\n",
      "events, the contrast just stated will hold good. But this is not all.\r\n",
      "Out of this lifeless mass has already grown an excrescent power,\r\n",
      "which tends to realize all the dangers that can be apprehended from a\r\n",
      "defective construction of the supreme government of the Union. It is now\r\n",
      "no longer a point of speculation and hope, that the Western territory\r\n",
      "is a mine of vast wealth to the United States; and although it is not of\r\n",
      "such a nature as to extricate them from their present distresses, or\r\n",
      "for some time to come, to yield any regular supplies for the public\r\n",

      "to effect a gradual discharge of the domestic debt, and to furnish, for\r\n",
      "a certain period, liberal tributes to the federal treasury. A very\r\n",

      "States; and it may with reason be expected that the remaining States\r\n",

      "the great body of the people. The Senate, like the present Congress,\r\n",

      "the people. The President is indirectly derived from the choice of the\r\n",
      "people, according to the example in most of the States. Even the judges,\r\n",

      "standard, and to the model of State constitutions The House of\r\n",
      "Representatives is periodically elective, as in all the States; and for\r\n",
      "the period of two years, as in the State of South Carolina. The Senate\r\n",
      "is elective, for the period of six years; which is but one year more\r\n",
      "than the period of the Senate of Maryland, and but two more than that\r\n",
      "of the Senates of New York and Virginia. The President is to continue\r\n",
      "in office for the period of four years; as in New York and Delaware, the\r\n",
      "chief magistrate is elected for three years, and in South Carolina for\r\n",
      "two years. In the other States the election is annual. In several of the\r\n",
      "States, however, no constitutional provision is made for the impeachment\r\n",
      "of the chief magistrate. And in Delaware and Virginia he is not\r\n",
      "impeachable till out of office. The President of the United States is\r\n",
      "impeachable at any time during his continuance in office. The tenure\r\n",
      "by which the judges are to hold their places, is, as it unquestionably\r\n",
      "ought to be, that of good behavior. The tenure of the ministerial\r\n",
      "offices generally, will be a subject of legal regulation, conformably to\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "which, they have framed a NATIONAL government, which regards the Union\r\n",
      "as a CONSOLIDATION of the States.\" And it is asked by what authority\r\n",
      "this bold and radical innovation was undertaken? The handle which has\r\n",
      "been made of this objection requires that it should be examined with\r\n",
      "some precision.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Without inquiring into the accuracy of the distinction on which the\r\n",
      "objection is founded, it will be necessary to a just estimate of its\r\n",
      "force, first, to ascertain the real character of the government in\r\n",
      "question; secondly, to inquire how far the convention were authorized\r\n",
      "to propose such a government; and thirdly, how far the duty they owed to\r\n",
      "their country could supply any defect of regular authority.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "First. In order to ascertain the real character of the government, it\r\n",
      "may be considered in relation to the foundation on which it is to be\r\n",
      "established; to the sources from which its ordinary powers are to be\r\n",
      "drawn; to the operation of those powers; to the extent of them; and\r\n",
      "to the authority by which future changes in the government are to be\r\n",
      "introduced.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On examining the first relation, it appears, on one hand, that the\r\n",
      "Constitution is to be founded on the assent and ratification of the\r\n",
      "people of America, given by deputies elected for the special purpose;\r\n",
      "but, on the other, that this assent and ratification is to be given\r\n",
      "by the people, not as individuals composing one entire nation, but as\r\n",
      "composing the distinct and independent States to which they respectively\r\n",
      "belong. It is to be the assent and ratification of the several States,\r\n",
      "derived from the supreme authority in each State, the authority of the\r\n",
      "people themselves. The act, therefore, establishing the Constitution,\r\n",
      "will not be a NATIONAL, but a FEDERAL act.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That it will be a federal and not a national act, as these terms are\r\n",
      "understood by the objectors; the act of the people, as forming so many\r\n",
      "independent States, not as forming one aggregate nation, is obvious\r\n",
      "from this single consideration, that it is to result neither from the\r\n",
      "decision of a MAJORITY of the people of the Union, nor from that of a\r\n",
      "MAJORITY of the States. It must result from the UNANIMOUS assent of the\r\n",
      "several States that are parties to it, differing no otherwise from their\r\n",
      "ordinary assent than in its being expressed, not by the legislative\r\n",
      "authority, but by that of the people themselves. Were the people\r\n",
      "regarded in this transaction as forming one nation, the will of the\r\n",
      "majority of the whole people of the United States would bind the\r\n",
      "minority, in the same manner as the majority in each State must bind the\r\n",
      "minority; and the will of the majority must be determined either by a\r\n",
      "comparison of the individual votes, or by considering the will of the\r\n",
      "majority of the States as evidence of the will of a majority of the\r\n",
      "people of the United States. Neither of these rules have been adopted.\r\n",
      "Each State, in ratifying the Constitution, is considered as a sovereign\r\n",
      "body, independent of all others, and only to be bound by its own\r\n",
      "voluntary act. In this relation, then, the new Constitution will, if\r\n",
      "established, be a FEDERAL, and not a NATIONAL constitution.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The next relation is, to the sources from which the ordinary powers of\r\n",
      "government are to be derived. The House of Representatives will\r\n",
      "derive its powers from the people of America; and the people will be\r\n",
      "represented in the same proportion, and on the same principle, as they\r\n",
      "are in the legislature of a particular State. So far the government is\r\n",
      "NATIONAL, not FEDERAL. The Senate, on the other hand, will derive its\r\n",
      "powers from the States, as political and coequal societies; and these\r\n",
      "will be represented on the principle of equality in the Senate, as they\r\n",
      "now are in the existing Congress. So far the government is FEDERAL,\r\n",
      "not NATIONAL. The executive power will be derived from a very compound\r\n",
      "source. The immediate election of the President is to be made by the\r\n",
      "States in their political characters. The votes allotted to them are in\r\n",
      "a compound ratio, which considers them partly as distinct and coequal\r\n",
      "societies, partly as unequal members of the same society. The eventual\r\n",
      "election, again, is to be made by that branch of the legislature which\r\n",
      "consists of the national representatives; but in this particular act\r\n",
      "they are to be thrown into the form of individual delegations, from\r\n",
      "so many distinct and coequal bodies politic. From this aspect of the\r\n",
      "government it appears to be of a mixed character, presenting at least as\r\n",
      "many FEDERAL as NATIONAL features.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The difference between a federal and national government, as it relates\r\n",
      "to the OPERATION OF THE GOVERNMENT, is supposed to consist in this, that\r\n",
      "in the former the powers operate on the political bodies composing\r\n",
      "the Confederacy, in their political capacities; in the latter, on\r\n",
      "the individual citizens composing the nation, in their individual\r\n",
      "capacities. On trying the Constitution by this criterion, it falls\r\n",
      "under the NATIONAL, not the FEDERAL character; though perhaps not so\r\n",
      "completely as has been understood. In several cases, and particularly in\r\n",
      "the trial of controversies to which States may be parties, they must\r\n",
      "be viewed and proceeded against in their collective and political\r\n",
      "capacities only. So far the national countenance of the government on\r\n",
      "this side seems to be disfigured by a few federal features. But this\r\n",
      "blemish is perhaps unavoidable in any plan; and the operation of\r\n",
      "the government on the people, in their individual capacities, in its\r\n",
      "ordinary and most essential proceedings, may, on the whole, designate\r\n",
      "it, in this relation, a NATIONAL government.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But if the government be national with regard to the OPERATION of its\r\n",
      "powers, it changes its aspect again when we contemplate it in relation\r\n",
      "to the EXTENT of its powers. The idea of a national government involves\r\n",
      "in it, not only an authority over the individual citizens, but an\r\n",
      "indefinite supremacy over all persons and things, so far as they are\r\n",
      "objects of lawful government. Among a people consolidated into one\r\n",
      "nation, this supremacy is completely vested in the national legislature.\r\n",
      "Among communities united for particular purposes, it is vested partly\r\n",
      "in the general and partly in the municipal legislatures. In the former\r\n",
      "case, all local authorities are subordinate to the supreme; and may be\r\n",
      "controlled, directed, or abolished by it at pleasure. In the latter, the\r\n",
      "local or municipal authorities form distinct and independent portions of\r\n",
      "the supremacy, no more subject, within their respective spheres, to the\r\n",
      "general authority, than the general authority is subject to them, within\r\n",
      "its own sphere. In this relation, then, the proposed government cannot\r\n",
      "be deemed a NATIONAL one; since its jurisdiction extends to certain\r\n",
      "enumerated objects only, and leaves to the several States a residuary\r\n",
      "and inviolable sovereignty over all other objects. It is true that in\r\n",
      "controversies relating to the boundary between the two jurisdictions,\r\n",
      "the tribunal which is ultimately to decide, is to be established under\r\n",
      "the general government. But this does not change the principle of the\r\n",
      "case. The decision is to be impartially made, according to the rules of\r\n",
      "the Constitution; and all the usual and most effectual precautions\r\n",
      "are taken to secure this impartiality. Some such tribunal is clearly\r\n",
      "essential to prevent an appeal to the sword and a dissolution of the\r\n",
      "compact; and that it ought to be established under the general rather\r\n",
      "than under the local governments, or, to speak more properly, that it\r\n",
      "could be safely established under the first alone, is a position not\r\n",
      "likely to be combated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If we try the Constitution by its last relation to the authority by\r\n",
      "which amendments are to be made, we find it neither wholly NATIONAL\r\n",
      "nor wholly FEDERAL. Were it wholly national, the supreme and ultimate\r\n",
      "authority would reside in the MAJORITY of the people of the Union; and\r\n",
      "this authority would be competent at all times, like that of a\r\n",
      "majority of every national society, to alter or abolish its established\r\n",
      "government. Were it wholly federal, on the other hand, the concurrence\r\n",
      "of each State in the Union would be essential to every alteration that\r\n",
      "would be binding on all. The mode provided by the plan of the convention\r\n",
      "is not founded on either of these principles. In requiring more than\r\n",
      "a majority, and principles. In requiring more than a majority, and\r\n",
      "particularly in computing the proportion by STATES, not by CITIZENS, it\r\n",
      "departs from the NATIONAL and advances towards the FEDERAL character;\r\n",
      "in rendering the concurrence of less than the whole number of States\r\n",
      "sufficient, it loses again the FEDERAL and partakes of the NATIONAL\r\n",
      "character.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The proposed Constitution, therefore, is, in strictness, neither a\r\n",
      "national nor a federal Constitution, but a composition of both. In its\r\n",
      "foundation it is federal, not national; in the sources from which the\r\n",
      "ordinary powers of the government are drawn, it is partly federal and\r\n",
      "partly national; in the operation of these powers, it is national, not\r\n",
      "federal; in the extent of them, again, it is federal, not national;\r\n",
      "and, finally, in the authoritative mode of introducing amendments, it is\r\n",

      "had not been in contemplation. Will it be said that the FUNDAMENTAL\r\n",
      "PRINCIPLES of the Confederation were not within the purview of the\r\n",
      "convention, and ought not to have been varied? I ask, What are\r\n",
      "these principles? Do they require that, in the establishment of the\r\n",
      "Constitution, the States should be regarded as distinct and independent\r\n",
      "sovereigns? They are so regarded by the Constitution proposed. Do\r\n",
      "they require that the members of the government should derive their\r\n",
      "appointment from the legislatures, not from the people of the\r\n",
      "States? One branch of the new government is to be appointed by these\r\n",
      "legislatures; and under the Confederation, the delegates to Congress\r\n",
      "MAY ALL be appointed immediately by the people, and in two States(1) are\r\n",
      "actually so appointed. Do they require that the powers of the government\r\n",
      "should act on the States, and not immediately on individuals? In some\r\n",
      "instances, as has been shown, the powers of the new government will act\r\n",
      "on the States in their collective characters. In some instances, also,\r\n",
      "those of the existing government act immediately on individuals. In\r\n",
      "cases of capture; of piracy; of the post office; of coins, weights, and\r\n",
      "measures; of trade with the Indians; of claims under grants of land\r\n",
      "by different States; and, above all, in the case of trials by\r\n",
      "courts-marshal in the army and navy, by which death may be inflicted\r\n",
      "without the intervention of a jury, or even of a civil magistrate; in\r\n",
      "all these cases the powers of the Confederation operate immediately on\r\n",
      "the persons and interests of individual citizens. Do these fundamental\r\n",
      "principles require, particularly, that no tax should be levied without\r\n",
      "the intermediate agency of the States? The Confederation itself\r\n",
      "authorizes a direct tax, to a certain extent, on the post office. The\r\n",
      "power of coinage has been so construed by Congress as to levy a tribute\r\n",
      "immediately from that source also. But pretermitting these instances,\r\n",
      "was it not an acknowledged object of the convention and the universal\r\n",
      "expectation of the people, that the regulation of trade should be\r\n",
      "submitted to the general government in such a form as would render it\r\n",
      "an immediate source of general revenue? Had not Congress repeatedly\r\n",

      "require that the powers of the general government should be limited,\r\n",
      "and that, beyond this limit, the States should be left in possession\r\n",
      "of their sovereignty and independence? We have seen that in the new\r\n",
      "government, as in the old, the general powers are limited; and that the\r\n",
      "States, in all unenumerated cases, are left in the enjoyment of their\r\n",
      "sovereign and independent jurisdiction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The truth is, that the great principles of the Constitution proposed\r\n",
      "by the convention may be considered less as absolutely new, than as\r\n",
      "the expansion of principles which are found in the articles of\r\n",
      "Confederation. The misfortune under the latter system has been, that\r\n",
      "these principles are so feeble and confined as to justify all the\r\n",
      "charges of inefficiency which have been urged against it, and to require\r\n",
      "a degree of enlargement which gives to the new system the aspect of an\r\n",
      "entire transformation of the old.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In one particular it is admitted that the convention have departed from\r\n",
      "the tenor of their commission. Instead of reporting a plan requiring the\r\n",
      "confirmation OF THE LEGISLATURES OF ALL THE STATES, they have reported\r\n",
      "a plan which is to be confirmed by the PEOPLE, and may be carried into\r\n",
      "effect by NINE STATES ONLY. It is worthy of remark that this objection,\r\n",
      "though the most plausible, has been the least urged in the publications\r\n",
      "which have swarmed against the convention. The forbearance can only have\r\n",
      "proceeded from an irresistible conviction of the absurdity of subjecting\r\n",

      "thirteenth; from the example of inflexible opposition given by a\r\n",
      "MAJORITY of one sixtieth of the people of America to a measure approved\r\n",

      "if they had been real and final powers for the establishment of a\r\n",
      "Constitution for the United States. We have seen in what manner they\r\n",
      "have borne the trial even on that supposition. It is time now to\r\n",
      "recollect that the powers were merely advisory and recommendatory; that\r\n",
      "they were so meant by the States, and so understood by the convention;\r\n",
      "and that the latter have accordingly planned and proposed a Constitution\r\n",
      "which is to be of no more consequence than the paper on which it is\r\n",
      "written, unless it be stamped with the approbation of those to whom\r\n",
      "it is addressed. This reflection places the subject in a point of view\r\n",
      "altogether different, and will enable us to judge with propriety of the\r\n",

      "impressed with the crisis, which had led their country almost with one\r\n",
      "voice to make so singular and solemn an experiment for correcting the\r\n",
      "errors of a system by which this crisis had been produced; that they\r\n",
      "were no less deeply and unanimously convinced that such a reform as they\r\n",
      "have proposed was absolutely necessary to effect the purposes of\r\n",
      "their appointment. It could not be unknown to them that the hopes\r\n",
      "and expectations of the great body of citizens, throughout this great\r\n",
      "empire, were turned with the keenest anxiety to the event of their\r\n",
      "deliberations. They had every reason to believe that the contrary\r\n",
      "sentiments agitated the minds and bosoms of every external and internal\r\n",
      "foe to the liberty and prosperity of the United States. They had seen in\r\n",

      "the PROPOSITION, made by a single State (Virginia), towards a partial\r\n",
      "amendment of the Confederation, had been attended to and promoted. They\r\n",
      "had seen the LIBERTY ASSUMED by a VERY FEW deputies from a VERY FEW\r\n",
      "States, convened at Annapolis, of recommending a great and critical\r\n",
      "object, wholly foreign to their commission, not only justified by the\r\n",
      "public opinion, but actually carried into effect by twelve out of the\r\n",
      "thirteen States. They had seen, in a variety of instances, assumptions\r\n",
      "by Congress, not only of recommendatory, but of operative, powers,\r\n",
      "warranted, in the public estimation, by occasions and objects infinitely\r\n",
      "less urgent than those by which their conduct was to be governed.\r\n",
      "They must have reflected, that in all great changes of established\r\n",
      "governments, forms ought to give way to substance; that a rigid\r\n",
      "adherence in such cases to the former, would render nominal and nugatory\r\n",

      "INFORMAL AND UNAUTHORIZED PROPOSITIONS, made by some patriotic and\r\n",
      "respectable citizen or number of citizens. They must have recollected\r\n",

      "people plans for their safety and happiness, that the States were first\r\n",
      "united against the danger with which they were threatened by their\r\n",

      "concentrating their efforts and defending their rights; and that\r\n",
      "CONVENTIONS were ELECTED in THE SEVERAL STATES for establishing the\r\n",

      "forgotten that no little ill-timed scruples, no zeal for adhering\r\n",
      "to ordinary forms, were anywhere seen, except in those who wished\r\n",
      "to indulge, under these masks, their secret enmity to the substance\r\n",
      "contended for. They must have borne in mind, that as the plan to be\r\n",
      "framed and proposed was to be submitted TO THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES, the\r\n",
      "disapprobation of this supreme authority would destroy it forever; its\r\n",

      "their neglect to execute the degree of power vested in them, and still\r\n",
      "more their recommendation of any measure whatever, not warranted\r\n",
