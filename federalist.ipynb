Saturday, October 27, 1787\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHAMILTON\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\r\\n\\r\\nAFTER an unequivocal experience of the inefficacy of the subsisting\\r\\nfederal government, you are called upon to deliberate on a new\\r\\nConstitution for the United States of America. The subject speaks its\\r\\nown importance; comprehending in its consequences nothing less than the\\r\\nexistence of the UNION, the safety and welfare of the parts of which it\\r\\nis composed, the fate of an empire in many respects the most interesting\\r\\nin the world. It has been frequently remarked that it seems to have been\\r\\nreserved to the people of this country, by their conduct and example,\\r\\nto decide the important question, whether societies of men are really\\r\\ncapable or not of establishing good government from reflection and\\r\\nchoice, or whether they are forever destined to depend for their\\r\\npolitical constitutions on accident and force. If there be any truth\\r\\nin the remark, the crisis at which we are arrived may with propriety be\\r\\nregarded as the era in which that decision is to be made; and a wrong\\r\\nelection of the part we shall act may, in this view, deserve to be\\r\\nconsidered as the general misfortune of mankind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis idea will add the inducements of philanthropy to those of\\r\\npatriotism, to heighten the solicitude which all considerate and good\\r\\nmen must feel for the event. Happy will it be if our choice should be\\r\\ndirected by a judicious estimate of our true interests, unperplexed and\\r\\nunbiased by considerations not connected with the public good. But this\\r\\nis a thing more ardently to be wished than seriously to be expected. The\\r\\nplan offered to our deliberations affects too many particular interests,\\r\\ninnovates upon too many local institutions, not to involve in its\\r\\ndiscussion a variety of objects foreign to its merits, and of views,\\r\\npassions and prejudices little favorable to the discovery of truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the most formidable of the obstacles which the new Constitution\\r\\nwill have to encounter may readily be distinguished the obvious interest\\r\\nof a certain class of men in every State to resist all changes which\\r\\nmay hazard a diminution of the power, emolument, and consequence of\\r\\nthe offices they hold under the State establishments; and the perverted\\r\\nambition of another class of men, who will either hope to aggrandize\\r\\nthemselves by the confusions of their country, or will flatter\\r\\nthemselves with fairer prospects of elevation from the subdivision of\\r\\nthe empire into several partial confederacies than from its union under\\r\\none government.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not, however, my design to dwell upon observations of this\\r\\nnature. I am well aware that it would be disingenuous to resolve\\r\\nindiscriminately the opposition of any set of men (merely because their\\r\\nsituations might subject them to suspicion) into interested or ambitious\\r\\nviews. Candor will oblige us to admit that even such men may be actuated\\r\\nby upright intentions; and it cannot be doubted that much of the\\r\\nopposition which has made its appearance, or may hereafter make its\\r\\nappearance, will spring from sources, blameless at least, if not\\r\\nrespectable--the honest errors of minds led astray by preconceived\\r\\njealousies and fears. So numerous indeed and so powerful are the causes\\r\\nwhich serve to give a false bias to the judgment, that we, upon many\\r\\noccasions, see wise and good men on the wrong as well as on the right\\r\\nside of questions of the first magnitude to society. This circumstance,\\r\\nif duly attended to, would furnish a lesson of moderation to those\\r\\nwho are ever so much persuaded of their being in the right in any\\r\\ncontroversy. And a further reason for caution, in this respect, might\\r\\nbe drawn from the reflection that we are not always sure that those\\r\\nwho advocate the truth are influenced by purer principles than their\\r\\nantagonists. Ambition, avarice, personal animosity, party opposition,\\r\\nand many other motives not more laudable than these, are apt to operate\\r\\nas well upon those who support as those who oppose the right side of a\\r\\nquestion. Were there not even these inducements to moderation, nothing\\r\\ncould be more ill-judged than that intolerant spirit which has, at all\\r\\ntimes, characterized political parties. For in politics, as in religion,\\r\\nit is equally absurd to aim at making proselytes by fire and sword.\\r\\nHeresies in either can rarely be cured by persecution.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet, however just these sentiments will be allowed to be, we have\\r\\nalready sufficient indications that it will happen in this as in all\\r\\nformer cases of great national discussion. A torrent of angry and\\r\\nmalignant passions will be let loose. To judge from the conduct of the\\r\\nopposite parties, we shall be led to conclude that they will mutually\\r\\nhope to evince the justness of their opinions, and to increase the\\r\\nnumber of their converts by the loudness of their declamations and the\\r\\nbitterness of their invectives. An enlightened zeal for the energy\\r\\nand efficiency of government will be stigmatized as the offspring of a\\r\\ntemper fond of despotic power and hostile to the principles of liberty.\\r\\nAn over-scrupulous jealousy of danger to the rights of the people,\\r\\nwhich is more commonly the fault of the head than of the heart, will be\\r\\nrepresented as mere pretense and artifice, the stale bait for popularity\\r\\nat the expense of the public good. It will be forgotten, on the one\\r\\nhand, that jealousy is the usual concomitant of love, and that the noble\\r\\nenthusiasm of liberty is apt to be infected with a spirit of narrow and\\r\\nilliberal distrust. On the other hand, it will be equally forgotten that\\r\\nthe vigor of government is essential to the security of liberty; that,\\r\\nin the contemplation of a sound and well-informed judgment, their\\r\\ninterest can never be separated; and that a dangerous ambition more\\r\\noften lurks behind the specious mask of zeal for the rights of the\\r\\npeople than under the forbidden appearance of zeal for the firmness and\\r\\nefficiency of government. History will teach us that the former has been\\r\\nfound a much more certain road to the introduction of despotism than\\r\\nthe latter, and that of those men who have overturned the liberties\\r\\nof republics, the greatest number have begun their career by paying\\r\\nan obsequious court to the people; commencing demagogues, and ending\\r\\ntyrants.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the course of the preceding observations, I have had an eye, my\\r\\nfellow-citizens, to putting you upon your guard against all attempts,\\r\\nfrom whatever quarter, to influence your decision in a matter of the\\r\\nutmost moment to your welfare, by any impressions other than those which\\r\\nmay result from the evidence of truth. You will, no doubt, at the same\\r\\ntime, have collected from the general scope of them, that they\\r\\nproceed from a source not unfriendly to the new Constitution. Yes,\\r\\nmy countrymen, I own to you that, after having given it an attentive\\r\\nconsideration, I am clearly of opinion it is your interest to adopt it.\\r\\nI am convinced that this is the safest course for your liberty, your\\r\\ndignity, and your happiness. I affect not reserves which I do not feel.\\r\\nI will not amuse you with an appearance of deliberation when I have\\r\\ndecided. I frankly acknowledge to you my convictions, and I will freely\\r\\nlay before you the reasons on which they are founded. The consciousness\\r\\nof good intentions disdains ambiguity. I shall not, however, multiply\\r\\nprofessions on this head. My motives must remain in the depository of\\r\\nmy own breast. My arguments will be open to all, and may be judged of by\\r\\nall. They shall at least be offered in a spirit which will not disgrace\\r\\nthe cause of truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nI propose, in a series of papers, to discuss the following interesting\\r\\nparticulars:\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE UTILITY OF THE UNION TO YOUR POLITICAL PROSPERITY THE INSUFFICIENCY\\r\\nOF THE PRESENT CONFEDERATION TO PRESERVE THAT UNION THE NECESSITY OF\\r\\nA GOVERNMENT AT LEAST EQUALLY ENERGETIC WITH THE ONE PROPOSED, TO THE\\r\\nATTAINMENT OF THIS OBJECT THE CONFORMITY OF THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTION\\r\\nTO THE TRUE PRINCIPLES OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT ITS ANALOGY TO YOUR\\r\\nOWN STATE CONSTITUTION and lastly, THE ADDITIONAL SECURITY WHICH ITS\\r\\nADOPTION WILL AFFORD TO THE PRESERVATION OF THAT SPECIES OF GOVERNMENT,\\r\\nTO LIBERTY, AND TO PROPERTY.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the progress of this discussion I shall endeavor to give a\\r\\nsatisfactory answer to all the objections which shall have made their\\r\\nappearance, that may seem to have any claim to your attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may perhaps be thought superfluous to offer arguments to prove the\\r\\nutility of the UNION, a point, no doubt, deeply engraved on the hearts\\r\\nof the great body of the people in every State, and one, which it may be\\r\\nimagined, has no adversaries. But the fact is, that we already hear\\r\\nit whispered in the private circles of those who oppose the new\\r\\nConstitution, that the thirteen States are of too great extent for\\r\\nany general system, and that we must of necessity resort to separate\\r\\nconfederacies of distinct portions of the whole.(1) This doctrine will,\\r\\nin all probability, be gradually propagated, till it has votaries enough\\r\\nto countenance an open avowal of it. For nothing can be more evident,\\r\\nto those who are able to take an enlarged view of the subject, than the\\r\\nalternative of an adoption of the new Constitution or a dismemberment\\r\\nof the Union. It will therefore be of use to begin by examining the\\r\\nadvantages of that Union, the certain evils, and the probable dangers,\\r\\nto which every State will be exposed from its dissolution. This shall\\r\\naccordingly constitute the subject of my next address.\\r\\n\\r\\n\", \"\\r\\n\\r\\nConcerning Dangers from Foreign Force and Influence\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the Independent Journal. Wednesday, October 31, 1787\\r\\n\\r\\nJAY\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\r\\n\\r\\nWHEN the people of America reflect that they are now called upon to\\r\\ndecide a question, which, in its consequences, must prove one of the\\r\\nmost important that ever engaged their attention, the propriety of their\\r\\ntaking a very comprehensive, as well as a very serious, view of it, will\\r\\nbe evident.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing is more certain than the indispensable necessity of government,\\r\\nand it is equally undeniable, that whenever and however it is\\r\\ninstituted, the people must cede to it some of their natural rights\\r\\nin order to vest it with requisite powers. It is well worthy of\\r\\nconsideration therefore, whether it would conduce more to the interest\\r\\nof the people of America that they should, to all general purposes, be\\r\\none nation, under one federal government, or that they should divide\\r\\nthemselves into separate confederacies, and give to the head of each\\r\\nthe same kind of powers which they are advised to place in one national\\r\\ngovernment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has until lately been a received and uncontradicted opinion that the\\r\\nprosperity of the people of America depended on their continuing firmly\\r\\nunited, and the wishes, prayers, and efforts of our best and wisest\\r\\ncitizens have been constantly directed to that object. But politicians\\r\\nnow appear, who insist that this opinion is erroneous, and that instead\\r\\nof looking for safety and happiness in union, we ought to seek it in\\r\\na division of the States into distinct confederacies or sovereignties.\\r\\nHowever extraordinary this new doctrine may appear, it nevertheless\\r\\nhas its advocates; and certain characters who were much opposed to it\\r\\nformerly, are at present of the number. Whatever may be the arguments\\r\\nor inducements which have wrought this change in the sentiments and\\r\\ndeclarations of these gentlemen, it certainly would not be wise in the\\r\\npeople at large to adopt these new political tenets without being fully\\r\\nconvinced that they are founded in truth and sound policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has often given me pleasure to observe that independent America\\r\\nwas not composed of detached and distant territories, but that one\\r\\nconnected, fertile, wide-spreading country was the portion of our western\\r\\nsons of liberty. Providence has in a particular manner blessed it with\\r\\na variety of soils and productions, and watered it with innumerable\\r\\nstreams, for the delight and accommodation of its inhabitants. A\\r\\nsuccession of navigable waters forms a kind of chain round its borders,\\r\\nas if to bind it together; while the most noble rivers in the world,\\r\\nrunning at convenient distances, present them with highways for the\\r\\neasy communication of friendly aids, and the mutual transportation and\\r\\nexchange of their various commodities.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith equal pleasure I have as often taken notice that Providence has\\r\\nbeen pleased to give this one connected country to one united people--a\\r\\npeople descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language,\\r\\nprofessing the same religion, attached to the same principles of\\r\\ngovernment, very similar in their manners and customs, and who, by their\\r\\njoint counsels, arms, and efforts, fighting side by side throughout\\r\\na long and bloody war, have nobly established general liberty and\\r\\nindependence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis country and this people seem to have been made for each other, and\\r\\nit appears as if it was the design of Providence, that an inheritance\\r\\nso proper and convenient for a band of brethren, united to each other\\r\\nby the strongest ties, should never be split into a number of unsocial,\\r\\njealous, and alien sovereignties.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilar sentiments have hitherto prevailed among all orders and\\r\\ndenominations of men among us. To all general purposes we have uniformly\\r\\nbeen one people each individual citizen everywhere enjoying the same\\r\\nnational rights, privileges, and protection. As a nation we have made\\r\\npeace and war; as a nation we have vanquished our common enemies; as\\r\\na nation we have formed alliances, and made treaties, and entered into\\r\\nvarious compacts and conventions with foreign states.\\r\\n\\r\\nA strong sense of the value and blessings of union induced the people,\\r\\nat a very early period, to institute a federal government to preserve\\r\\nand perpetuate it. They formed it almost as soon as they had a political\\r\\nexistence; nay, at a time when their habitations were in flames, when\\r\\nmany of their citizens were bleeding, and when the progress of hostility\\r\\nand desolation left little room for those calm and mature inquiries\\r\\nand reflections which must ever precede the formation of a wise and\\r\\nwell-balanced government for a free people. It is not to be wondered\\r\\nat, that a government instituted in times so inauspicious, should on\\r\\nexperiment be found greatly deficient and inadequate to the purpose it\\r\\nwas intended to answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis intelligent people perceived and regretted these defects. Still\\r\\ncontinuing no less attached to union than enamored of liberty, they\\r\\nobserved the danger which immediately threatened the former and more\\r\\nremotely the latter; and being persuaded that ample security for both\\r\\ncould only be found in a national government more wisely framed, they\\r\\nas with one voice, convened the late convention at Philadelphia, to take\\r\\nthat important subject under consideration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis convention composed of men who possessed the confidence of the\\r\\npeople, and many of whom had become highly distinguished by their\\r\\npatriotism, virtue and wisdom, in times which tried the minds and hearts\\r\\nof men, undertook the arduous task. In the mild season of peace, with\\r\\nminds unoccupied by other subjects, they passed many months in cool,\\r\\nuninterrupted, and daily consultation; and finally, without having\\r\\nbeen awed by power, or influenced by any passions except love for their\\r\\ncountry, they presented and recommended to the people the plan produced\\r\\nby their joint and very unanimous councils.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmit, for so is the fact, that this plan is only RECOMMENDED, not\\r\\nimposed, yet let it be remembered that it is neither recommended to\\r\\nBLIND approbation, nor to BLIND reprobation; but to that sedate and\\r\\ncandid consideration which the magnitude and importance of the subject\\r\\ndemand, and which it certainly ought to receive. But this (as was\\r\\nremarked in the foregoing number of this paper) is more to be wished\\r\\nthan expected, that it may be so considered and examined. Experience on\\r\\na former occasion teaches us not to be too sanguine in such hopes. It\\r\\nis not yet forgotten that well-grounded apprehensions of imminent danger\\r\\ninduced the people of America to form the memorable Congress of 1774.\\r\\nThat body recommended certain measures to their constituents, and the\\r\\nevent proved their wisdom; yet it is fresh in our memories how soon the\\r\\npress began to teem with pamphlets and weekly papers against those very\\r\\nmeasures. Not only many of the officers of government, who obeyed the\\r\\ndictates of personal interest, but others, from a mistaken estimate of\\r\\nconsequences, or the undue influence of former attachments, or whose\\r\\nambition aimed at objects which did not correspond with the public good,\\r\\nwere indefatigable in their efforts to persuade the people to reject\\r\\nthe advice of that patriotic Congress. Many, indeed, were deceived\\r\\nand deluded, but the great majority of the people reasoned and decided\\r\\njudiciously; and happy they are in reflecting that they did so.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey considered that the Congress was composed of many wise and\\r\\nexperienced men. That, being convened from different parts of the\\r\\ncountry, they brought with them and communicated to each other a variety\\r\\nof useful information. That, in the course of the time they passed\\r\\ntogether in inquiring into and discussing the true interests of their\\r\\ncountry, they must have acquired very accurate knowledge on that\\r\\nhead. That they were individually interested in the public liberty and\\r\\nprosperity, and therefore that it was not less their inclination than\\r\\ntheir duty to recommend only such measures as, after the most mature\\r\\ndeliberation, they really thought prudent and advisable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese and similar considerations then induced the people to rely greatly\\r\\non the judgment and integrity of the Congress; and they took their\\r\\nadvice, notwithstanding the various arts and endeavors used to deter\\r\\nthem from it. But if the people at large had reason to confide in the\\r\\nmen of that Congress, few of whom had been fully tried or generally\\r\\nknown, still greater reason have they now to respect the judgment and\\r\\nadvice of the convention, for it is well known that some of the most\\r\\ndistinguished members of that Congress, who have been since tried and\\r\\njustly approved for patriotism and abilities, and who have grown old in\\r\\nacquiring political information, were also members of this convention,\\r\\nand carried into it their accumulated knowledge and experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is worthy of remark that not only the first, but every succeeding\\r\\nCongress, as well as the late convention, have invariably joined with\\r\\nthe people in thinking that the prosperity of America depended on its\\r\\nUnion. To preserve and perpetuate it was the great object of the people\\r\\nin forming that convention, and it is also the great object of the plan\\r\\nwhich the convention has advised them to adopt. With what propriety,\\r\\ntherefore, or for what good purposes, are attempts at this particular\\r\\nperiod made by some men to depreciate the importance of the Union? Or\\r\\nwhy is it suggested that three or four confederacies would be better\\r\\nthan one? I am persuaded in my own mind that the people have always\\r\\nthought right on this subject, and that their universal and uniform\\r\\nattachment to the cause of the Union rests on great and weighty reasons,\\r\\nwhich I shall endeavor to develop and explain in some ensuing papers.\\r\\nThey who promote the idea of substituting a number of distinct\\r\\nconfederacies in the room of the plan of the convention, seem clearly to\\r\\nforesee that the rejection of it would put the continuance of the\\r\\nUnion in the utmost jeopardy. That certainly would be the case, and I\\r\\nsincerely wish that it may be as clearly foreseen by every good citizen,\\r\\nthat whenever the dissolution of the Union arrives, America will have\\r\\nreason to exclaim, in the words of the poet: \\\"FAREWELL! A LONG FAREWELL\\r\\nTO ALL MY GREATNESS.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\", \"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Same Subject Continued (Concerning Dangers From Foreign Force and\\r\\nInfluence)\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the Independent Journal. Saturday, November 3, 1787\\r\\n\\r\\nJAY\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\r\\n\\r\\nIT IS not a new observation that the people of any country (if, like\\r\\nthe Americans, intelligent and wellinformed) seldom adopt and steadily\\r\\npersevere for many years in an erroneous opinion respecting their\\r\\ninterests. That consideration naturally tends to create great respect\\r\\nfor the high opinion which the people of America have so long and\\r\\nuniformly entertained of the importance of their continuing firmly\\r\\nunited under one federal government, vested with sufficient powers for\\r\\nall general and national purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe more attentively I consider and investigate the reasons which appear\\r\\nto have given birth to this opinion, the more I become convinced that\\r\\nthey are cogent and conclusive.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the many objects to which a wise and free people find it necessary\\r\\nto direct their attention, that of providing for their SAFETY seems to\\r\\nbe the first. The SAFETY of the people doubtless has relation to a great\\r\\nvariety of circumstances and considerations, and consequently\\r\\naffords great latitude to those who wish to define it precisely and\\r\\ncomprehensively.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt present I mean only to consider it as it respects security for the\\r\\npreservation of peace and tranquillity, as well as against dangers from\\r\\nFOREIGN ARMS AND INFLUENCE, as from dangers of the LIKE KIND arising\\r\\nfrom domestic causes. As the former of these comes first in order, it\\r\\nis proper it should be the first discussed. Let us therefore proceed to\\r\\nexamine whether the people are not right in their opinion that a cordial\\r\\nUnion, under an efficient national government, affords them the best\\r\\nsecurity that can be devised against HOSTILITIES from abroad.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of wars which have happened or will happen in the world will\\r\\nalways be found to be in proportion to the number and weight of the\\r\\ncauses, whether REAL or PRETENDED, which PROVOKE or INVITE them. If this\\r\\nremark be just, it becomes useful to inquire whether so many JUST causes\\r\\nof war are likely to be given by UNITED AMERICA as by DISUNITED America;\\r\\nfor if it should turn out that United America will probably give the\\r\\nfewest, then it will follow that in this respect the Union tends most to\\r\\npreserve the people in a state of peace with other nations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe JUST causes of war, for the most part, arise either from violation\\r\\nof treaties or from direct violence. America has already formed treaties\\r\\nwith no less than six foreign nations, and all of them, except Prussia,\\r\\nare maritime, and therefore able to annoy and injure us. She has also\\r\\nextensive commerce with Portugal, Spain, and Britain, and, with respect\\r\\nto the two latter, has, in addition, the circumstance of neighborhood to\\r\\nattend to.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is of high importance to the peace of America that she observe the\\r\\nlaws of nations towards all these powers, and to me it appears evident\\r\\nthat this will be more perfectly and punctually done by one national\\r\\ngovernment than it could be either by thirteen separate States or by\\r\\nthree or four distinct confederacies.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause when once an efficient national government is established, the\\r\\nbest men in the country will not only consent to serve, but also will\\r\\ngenerally be appointed to manage it; for, although town or country,\\r\\nor other contracted influence, may place men in State assemblies,\\r\\nor senates, or courts of justice, or executive departments, yet more\\r\\ngeneral and extensive reputation for talents and other qualifications\\r\\nwill be necessary to recommend men to offices under the national\\r\\ngovernment,--especially as it will have the widest field for choice, and\\r\\nnever experience that want of proper persons which is not uncommon in\\r\\nsome of the States. Hence, it will result that the administration,\\r\\nthe political counsels, and the judicial decisions of the national\\r\\ngovernment will be more wise, systematical, and judicious than those of\\r\\nindividual States, and consequently more satisfactory with respect to\\r\\nother nations, as well as more SAFE with respect to us.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause, under the national government, treaties and articles of\\r\\ntreaties, as well as the laws of nations, will always be expounded in\\r\\none sense and executed in the same manner,--whereas, adjudications on\\r\\nthe same points and questions, in thirteen States, or in three or four\\r\\nconfederacies, will not always accord or be consistent; and that, as\\r\\nwell from the variety of independent courts and judges appointed by\\r\\ndifferent and independent governments, as from the different local laws\\r\\nand interests which may affect and influence them. The wisdom of\\r\\nthe convention, in committing such questions to the jurisdiction and\\r\\njudgment of courts appointed by and responsible only to one national\\r\\ngovernment, cannot be too much commended.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the prospect of present loss or advantage may often tempt the\\r\\ngoverning party in one or two States to swerve from good faith and\\r\\njustice; but those temptations, not reaching the other States, and\\r\\nconsequently having little or no influence on the national government,\\r\\nthe temptation will be fruitless, and good faith and justice be\\r\\npreserved. The case of the treaty of peace with Britain adds great\\r\\nweight to this reasoning.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause, even if the governing party in a State should be disposed to\\r\\nresist such temptations, yet as such temptations may, and commonly do,\\r\\nresult from circumstances peculiar to the State, and may affect a great\\r\\nnumber of the inhabitants, the governing party may not always be\\r\\nable, if willing, to prevent the injustice meditated, or to punish the\\r\\naggressors. But the national government, not being affected by those\\r\\nlocal circumstances, will neither be induced to commit the wrong\\r\\nthemselves, nor want power or inclination to prevent or punish its\\r\\ncommission by others.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far, therefore, as either designed or accidental violations of\\r\\ntreaties and the laws of nations afford JUST causes of war, they are\\r\\nless to be apprehended under one general government than under several\\r\\nlesser ones, and in that respect the former most favors the SAFETY of\\r\\nthe people.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to those just causes of war which proceed from direct and unlawful\\r\\nviolence, it appears equally clear to me that one good national\\r\\ngovernment affords vastly more security against dangers of that sort\\r\\nthan can be derived from any other quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause such violences are more frequently caused by the passions and\\r\\ninterests of a part than of the whole; of one or two States than of the\\r\\nUnion. Not a single Indian war has yet been occasioned by aggressions of\\r\\nthe present federal government, feeble as it is; but there are several\\r\\ninstances of Indian hostilities having been provoked by the improper\\r\\nconduct of individual States, who, either unable or unwilling to\\r\\nrestrain or punish offenses, have given occasion to the slaughter of\\r\\nmany innocent inhabitants.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood of Spanish and British territories, bordering on some\\r\\nStates and not on others, naturally confines the causes of quarrel more\\r\\nimmediately to the borderers. The bordering States, if any, will be\\r\\nthose who, under the impulse of sudden irritation, and a quick sense of\\r\\napparent interest or injury, will be most likely, by direct violence,\\r\\nto excite war with these nations; and nothing can so effectually obviate\\r\\nthat danger as a national government, whose wisdom and prudence will\\r\\nnot be diminished by the passions which actuate the parties immediately\\r\\ninterested.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut not only fewer just causes of war will be given by the national\\r\\ngovernment, but it will also be more in their power to accommodate and\\r\\nsettle them amicably. They will be more temperate and cool, and in that\\r\\nrespect, as well as in others, will be more in capacity to act advisedly\\r\\nthan the offending State. The pride of states, as well as of men,\\r\\nnaturally disposes them to justify all their actions, and opposes their\\r\\nacknowledging, correcting, or repairing their errors and offenses. The\\r\\nnational government, in such cases, will not be affected by this pride,\\r\\nbut will proceed with moderation and candor to consider and decide on\\r\\nthe means most proper to extricate them from the difficulties which\\r\\nthreaten them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides, it is well known that acknowledgments, explanations, and\\r\\ncompensations are often accepted as satisfactory from a strong united\\r\\nnation, which would be rejected as unsatisfactory if offered by a State\\r\\nor confederacy of little consideration or power.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the year 1685, the state of Genoa having offended Louis,\\r\\nendeavored to appease him. He demanded that they should send their Doge,\\r\\nor chief magistrate, accompanied by four of their senators, to FRANCE,\\r\\nto ask his pardon and receive his terms. They were obliged to submit to\\r\\nit for the sake of peace.

Wednesday, November 7, 1787\\r\\n\\r\\nJAY\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\r\\n\\r\\nMY LAST paper assigned several reasons why the safety of the people\\r\\nwould be best secured by union against the danger it may be exposed to\\r\\nby JUST causes of war given to other nations; and those reasons show\\r\\nthat such causes would not only be more rarely given, but would also be\\r\\nmore easily accommodated, by a national government than either by the\\r\\nState governments or the proposed little confederacies.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the safety of the people of America against dangers from FOREIGN\\r\\nforce depends not only on their forbearing to give JUST causes of war\\r\\nto other nations, but also on their placing and continuing themselves in\\r\\nsuch a situation as not to INVITE hostility or insult; for it need not\\r\\nbe observed that there are PRETENDED as well as just causes of war.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is too true, however disgraceful it may be to human nature, that\\r\\nnations in general will make war whenever they have a prospect of\\r\\ngetting anything by it; nay, absolute monarchs will often make war when\\r\\ntheir nations are to get nothing by it, but for the purposes and objects\\r\\nmerely personal, such as thirst for military glory, revenge for personal\\r\\naffronts, ambition, or private compacts to aggrandize or support their\\r\\nparticular families or partisans. These and a variety of other motives,\\r\\nwhich affect only the mind of the sovereign, often lead him to engage in\\r\\nwars not sanctified by justice or the voice and interests of his people.\\r\\nBut, independent of these inducements to war, which are more prevalent\\r\\nin absolute monarchies, but which well deserve our attention, there are\\r\\nothers which affect nations as often as kings; and some of them will\\r\\non examination be found to grow out of our relative situation and\\r\\ncircumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith France and with Britain we are rivals in the fisheries, and can\\r\\nsupply their markets cheaper than they can themselves, notwithstanding\\r\\nany efforts to prevent it by bounties on their own or duties on foreign\\r\\nfish.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith them and with most other European nations we are rivals in\\r\\nnavigation and the carrying trade; and we shall deceive ourselves if we\\r\\nsuppose that any of them will rejoice to see it flourish; for, as\\r\\nour carrying trade cannot increase without in some degree diminishing\\r\\ntheirs, it is more their interest, and will be more their policy, to\\r\\nrestrain than to promote it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the trade to China and India, we interfere with more than one nation,\\r\\ninasmuch as it enables us to partake in advantages which they had in a\\r\\nmanner monopolized, and as we thereby supply ourselves with commodities\\r\\nwhich we used to purchase from them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe extension of our own commerce in our own vessels cannot give\\r\\npleasure to any nations who possess territories on or near this\\r\\ncontinent, because the cheapness and excellence of our productions,\\r\\nadded to the circumstance of vicinity, and the enterprise and address\\r\\nof our merchants and navigators, will give us a greater share in the\\r\\nadvantages which those territories afford, than consists with the wishes\\r\\nor policy of their respective sovereigns.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpain thinks it convenient to shut the Mississippi against us on the one\\r\\nside, and Britain excludes us from the Saint Lawrence on the other; nor\\r\\nwill either of them permit the other waters which are between them and\\r\\nus to become the means of mutual intercourse and traffic.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom these and such like considerations, which might, if consistent\\r\\nwith prudence, be more amplified and detailed, it is easy to see that\\r\\njealousies and uneasinesses may gradually slide into the minds and\\r\\ncabinets of other nations, and that we are not to expect that they\\r\\nshould regard our advancement in union, in power and consequence by land\\r\\nand by sea, with an eye of indifference and composure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe people of America are aware that inducements to war may arise out of\\r\\nthese circumstances, as well as from others not so obvious at present,\\r\\nand that whenever such inducements may find fit time and opportunity\\r\\nfor operation, pretenses to color and justify them will not be wanting.\\r\\nWisely, therefore, do they consider union and a good national government\\r\\nas necessary to put and keep them in SUCH A SITUATION as, instead of\\r\\nINVITING war, will tend to repress and discourage it. That situation\\r\\nconsists in the best possible state of defense, and necessarily depends\\r\\non the government, the arms, and the resources of the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the safety of the whole is the interest of the whole, and cannot\\r\\nbe provided for without government, either one or more or many, let us\\r\\ninquire whether one good government is not, relative to the object in\\r\\nquestion, more competent than any other given number whatever.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne government can collect and avail itself of the talents and\\r\\nexperience of the ablest men, in whatever part of the Union they may be\\r\\nfound. It can move on uniform principles of policy. It can harmonize,\\r\\nassimilate, and protect the several parts and members, and extend the\\r\\nbenefit of its foresight and precautions to each. In the formation of\\r\\ntreaties, it will regard the interest of the whole, and the particular\\r\\ninterests of the parts as connected with that of the whole. It can apply\\r\\nthe resources and power of the whole to the defense of any particular\\r\\npart, and that more easily and expeditiously than State governments or\\r\\nseparate confederacies can possibly do, for want of concert and unity of\\r\\nsystem. It can place the militia under one plan of discipline, and, by\\r\\nputting their officers in a proper line of subordination to the Chief\\r\\nMagistrate, will, as it were, consolidate them into one corps, and\\r\\nthereby render them more efficient than if divided into thirteen or into\\r\\nthree or four distinct independent companies.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat would the militia of Britain be if the English militia obeyed the\\r\\ngovernment of England, if the Scotch militia obeyed the government\\r\\nof Scotland, and if the Welsh militia obeyed the government of Wales?\\r\\nSuppose an invasion; would those three governments (if they agreed at\\r\\nall) be able, with all their respective forces, to operate against the\\r\\nenemy so effectually as the single government of Great Britain would?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have heard much of the fleets of Britain, and the time may come, if\\r\\nwe are wise, when the fleets of America may engage attention. But if one\\r\\nnational government, had not so regulated the navigation of Britain\\r\\nas to make it a nursery for seamen--if one national government had not\\r\\ncalled forth all the national means and materials for forming fleets,\\r\\ntheir prowess and their thunder would never have been celebrated. Let\\r\\nEngland have its navigation and fleet--let Scotland have its navigation\\r\\nand fleet--let Wales have its navigation and fleet--let Ireland have\\r\\nits navigation and fleet--let those four of the constituent parts of the\\r\\nBritish empire be under four independent governments, and it is\\r\\neasy to perceive how soon they would each dwindle into comparative\\r\\ninsignificance.\\r\\n\\r\\nApply these facts to our own case. Leave America divided into thirteen\\r\\nor, if you please, into three or four independent governments--what\\r\\narmies could they raise and pay--what fleets could they ever hope to\\r\\nhave? If one was attacked, would the others fly to its succor, and spend\\r\\ntheir blood and money in its defense? Would there be no danger of their\\r\\nbeing flattered into neutrality by its specious promises, or seduced by\\r\\na too great fondness for peace to decline hazarding their tranquillity\\r\\nand present safety for the sake of neighbors, of whom perhaps they have\\r\\nbeen jealous, and whose importance they are content to see diminished?\\r\\nAlthough such conduct would not be wise, it would, nevertheless, be\\r\\nnatural. The history of the states of Greece, and of other countries,\\r\\nabounds with such instances, and it is not improbable that what has so\\r\\noften happened would, under similar circumstances, happen again.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut admit that they might be willing to help the invaded State or\\r\\nconfederacy. How, and when, and in what proportion shall aids of men and\\r\\nmoney be afforded? Who shall command the allied armies, and from which\\r\\nof them shall he receive his orders? Who shall settle the terms of\\r\\npeace, and in case of disputes what umpire shall decide between them and\\r\\ncompel acquiescence? Various difficulties and inconveniences would be\\r\\ninseparable from such a situation; whereas one government, watching over\\r\\nthe general and common interests, and combining and directing the powers\\r\\nand resources of the whole, would be free from all these embarrassments,\\r\\nand conduce far more to the safety of the people.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut whatever may be our situation, whether firmly united under one\\r\\nnational government, or split into a number of confederacies, certain\\r\\nit is, that foreign nations will know and view it exactly as it is;\\r\\nand they will act toward us accordingly. If they see that our national\\r\\ngovernment is efficient and well administered, our trade prudently\\r\\nregulated, our militia properly organized and disciplined, our resources\\r\\nand finances discreetly managed, our credit re-established, our\\r\\npeople free, contented, and united, they will be much more disposed to\\r\\ncultivate our friendship than provoke our resentment. If, on the other\\r\\nhand, they find us either destitute of an effectual government (each\\r\\nState doing right or wrong, as to its rulers may seem convenient), or\\r\\nsplit into three or four independent and probably discordant republics\\r\\nor confederacies, one inclining to Britain, another to France, and a\\r\\nthird to Spain, and perhaps played off against each other by the three,\\r\\nwhat a poor, pitiful figure will America make in their eyes! How liable\\r\\nwould she become not only to their contempt but to their outrage, and\\r\\nhow soon would dear-bought experience proclaim that when a people or\\r\\nfamily so divide, it never fails to be against themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\n\", \"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Same Subject Continued (Concerning Dangers From Foreign Force and\\r\\nInfluence)\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the Independent Journal. Saturday, November 10, 1787\\r\\n\\r\\nJAY\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\r\\n\\r\\nQUEEN ANNE, in her letter of the 1st July, 1706, to the Scotch\\r\\nParliament, makes some observations on the importance of the UNION then\\r\\nforming between England and Scotland, which merit our attention. I shall\\r\\npresent the public with one or two extracts from it: \\\"An entire and\\r\\nperfect union will be the solid foundation of lasting peace: It will\\r\\nsecure your religion, liberty, and property; remove the animosities\\r\\namongst yourselves, and the jealousies and differences betwixt our two\\r\\nkingdoms. It must increase your strength, riches, and trade; and by\\r\\nthis union the whole island, being joined in affection and free from all\\r\\napprehensions of different interest, will be ENABLED TO RESIST ALL ITS\\r\\nENEMIES.\\\" \\\"We most earnestly recommend to you calmness and unanimity in\\r\\nthis great and weighty affair, that the union may be brought to a happy\\r\\nconclusion, being the only EFFECTUAL way to secure our present and\\r\\nfuture happiness, and disappoint the designs of our and your enemies,\\r\\nwho will doubtless, on this occasion, USE THEIR UTMOST ENDEAVORS TO\\r\\nPREVENT OR DELAY THIS UNION.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was remarked in the preceding paper, that weakness and divisions at\\r\\nhome would invite dangers from abroad; and that nothing would tend more\\r\\nto secure us from them than union, strength, and good government within\\r\\nourselves. This subject is copious and cannot easily be exhausted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe history of Great Britain is the one with which we are in general the\\r\\nbest acquainted, and it gives us many useful lessons. We may profit by\\r\\ntheir experience without paying the price which it cost them. Although\\r\\nit seems obvious to common sense that the people of such an island\\r\\nshould be but one nation, yet we find that they were for ages divided\\r\\ninto three, and that those three were almost constantly embroiled in\\r\\nquarrels and wars with one another. Notwithstanding their true interest\\r\\nwith respect to the continental nations was really the same, yet by the\\r\\narts and policy and practices of those nations, their mutual jealousies\\r\\nwere perpetually kept inflamed, and for a long series of years they\\r\\nwere far more inconvenient and troublesome than they were useful and\\r\\nassisting to each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould the people of America divide themselves into three or four\\r\\nnations, would not the same thing happen? Would not similar jealousies\\r\\narise, and be in like manner cherished? Instead of their being \\\"joined\\r\\nin affection\\\" and free from all apprehension of different \\\"interests,\\\"\\r\\nenvy and jealousy would soon extinguish confidence and affection,\\r\\nand the partial interests of each confederacy, instead of the general\\r\\ninterests of all America, would be the only objects of their policy and\\r\\npursuits. Hence, like most other BORDERING nations, they would always\\r\\nbe either involved in disputes and war, or live in the constant\\r\\napprehension of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most sanguine advocates for three or four confederacies cannot\\r\\nreasonably suppose that they would long remain exactly on an equal\\r\\nfooting in point of strength, even if it was possible to form them so at\\r\\nfirst; but, admitting that to be practicable, yet what human contrivance\\r\\ncan secure the continuance of such equality? Independent of those local\\r\\ncircumstances which tend to beget and increase power in one part and to\\r\\nimpede its progress in another, we must advert to the effects of that\\r\\nsuperior policy and good management which would probably distinguish the\\r\\ngovernment of one above the rest, and by which their relative equality\\r\\nin strength and consideration would be destroyed. For it cannot be\\r\\npresumed that the same degree of sound policy, prudence, and foresight\\r\\nwould uniformly be observed by each of these confederacies for a long\\r\\nsuccession of years.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhenever, and from whatever causes, it might happen, and happen it\\r\\nwould, that any one of these nations or confederacies should rise on the\\r\\nscale of political importance much above the degree of her neighbors,\\r\\nthat moment would those neighbors behold her with envy and with fear.\\r\\nBoth those passions would lead them to countenance, if not to promote,\\r\\nwhatever might promise to diminish her importance; and would also\\r\\nrestrain them from measures calculated to advance or even to secure her\\r\\nprosperity. Much time would not be necessary to enable her to discern\\r\\nthese unfriendly dispositions. She would soon begin, not only to lose\\r\\nconfidence in her neighbors, but also to feel a disposition equally\\r\\nunfavorable to them. Distrust naturally creates distrust, and by nothing\\r\\nis good-will and kind conduct more speedily changed than by invidious\\r\\njealousies and uncandid imputations, whether expressed or implied.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe North is generally the region of strength, and many local\\r\\ncircumstances render it probable that the most Northern of the proposed\\r\\nconfederacies would, at a period not very distant, be unquestionably\\r\\nmore formidable than any of the others. No sooner would this become\\r\\nevident than the NORTHERN HIVE would excite the same ideas and\\r\\nsensations in the more southern parts of America which it formerly\\r\\ndid in the southern parts of Europe. Nor does it appear to be a rash\\r\\nconjecture that its young swarms might often be tempted to gather honey\\r\\nin the more blooming fields and milder air of their luxurious and more\\r\\ndelicate neighbors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey who well consider the history of similar divisions and\\r\\nconfederacies will find abundant reason to apprehend that those in\\r\\ncontemplation would in no other sense be neighbors than as they would\\r\\nbe borderers; that they would neither love nor trust one another, but on\\r\\nthe contrary would be a prey to discord, jealousy, and mutual injuries;\\r\\nin short, that they would place us exactly in the situations in which\\r\\nsome nations doubtless wish to see us, viz., FORMIDABLE ONLY TO EACH\\r\\nOTHER.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom these considerations it appears that those gentlemen are greatly\\r\\nmistaken who suppose that alliances offensive and defensive might be\\r\\nformed between these confederacies, and would produce that combination\\r\\nand union of wills of arms and of resources, which would be necessary\\r\\nto put and keep them in a formidable state of defense against foreign\\r\\nenemies.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen did the independent states, into which Britain and Spain were\\r\\nformerly divided, combine in such alliance, or unite their forces\\r\\nagainst a foreign enemy? The proposed confederacies will be DISTINCT\\r\\nNATIONS. Each of them would have its commerce with foreigners to\\r\\nregulate by distinct treaties; and as their productions and commodities\\r\\nare different and proper for different markets, so would those treaties\\r\\nbe essentially different. Different commercial concerns must create\\r\\ndifferent interests, and of course different degrees of political\\r\\nattachment to and connection with different foreign nations. Hence it\\r\\nmight and probably would happen that the foreign nation with whom the\\r\\nSOUTHERN confederacy might be at war would be the one with whom the\\r\\nNORTHERN confederacy would be the most desirous of preserving peace and\\r\\nfriendship. An alliance so contrary to their immediate interest would\\r\\nnot therefore be easy to form, nor, if formed, would it be observed and\\r\\nfulfilled with perfect good faith.\\r\\n\\r\\nNay, it is far more probable that in America, as in Europe, neighboring\\r\\nnations, acting under the impulse of opposite interests and unfriendly\\r\\npassions, would frequently be found taking different sides. Considering\\r\\nour distance from Europe, it would be more natural for these\\r\\nconfederacies to apprehend danger from one another than from distant\\r\\nnations, and therefore that each of them should be more desirous to\\r\\nguard against the others by the aid of foreign alliances, than to guard\\r\\nagainst foreign dangers by alliances between themselves. And here let us\\r\\nnot forget how much more easy it is to receive foreign fleets into our\\r\\nports, and foreign armies into our country, than it is to persuade or\\r\\ncompel them to depart. How many conquests did the Romans and others make\\r\\nin the characters of allies, and what innovations did they under\\r\\nthe same character introduce into the governments of those whom they\\r\\npretended to protect.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet candid men judge, then, whether the division of America into any\\r\\ngiven number of independent sovereignties would tend to secure us\\r\\nagainst the hostilities and improper interference of foreign nations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\", \"\\r\\n\\r\\nConcerning Dangers from Dissensions Between the States\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the Independent Journal. Wednesday, November 14, 1787\\r\\n\\r\\nHAMILTON\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE three last numbers of this paper have been dedicated to an\\r\\nenumeration of the dangers to which we should be exposed, in a state of\\r\\ndisunion, from the arms and arts of foreign nations. I shall now proceed\\r\\nto delineate dangers of a different and, perhaps, still more alarming\\r\\nkind--those which will in all probability flow from dissensions between\\r\\nthe States themselves, and from domestic factions and convulsions.\\r\\nThese have been already in some instances slightly anticipated; but they\\r\\ndeserve a more particular and more full investigation.\\r\\n\\r\\nA man must be far gone in Utopian speculations who can seriously doubt\\r\\nthat, if these States should either be wholly disunited, or only united\\r\\nin partial confederacies, the subdivisions into which they might be\\r\\nthrown would have frequent and violent contests with each other. To\\r\\npresume a want of motives for such contests as an argument against their\\r\\nexistence, would be to forget that men are ambitious, vindictive, and\\r\\nrapacious. To look for a continuation of harmony between a number of\\r\\nindependent, unconnected sovereignties in the same neighborhood, would\\r\\nbe to disregard the uniform course of human events, and to set at\\r\\ndefiance the accumulated experience of ages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe causes of hostility among nations are innumerable. There are some\\r\\nwhich have a general and almost constant operation upon the collective\\r\\nbodies of society. Of this description are the love of power or the\\r\\ndesire of pre-eminence and dominion--the jealousy of power, or the\\r\\ndesire of equality and safety. There are others which have a more\\r\\ncircumscribed though an equally operative influence within their\\r\\nspheres. Such are the rivalships and competitions of commerce between\\r\\ncommercial nations. And there are others, not less numerous than either\\r\\nof the former, which take their origin entirely in private passions;\\r\\nin the attachments, enmities, interests, hopes, and fears of leading\\r\\nindividuals in the communities of which they are members. Men of this\\r\\nclass, whether the favorites of a king or of a people, have in too many\\r\\ninstances abused the confidence they possessed; and assuming the pretext\\r\\nof some public motive, have not scrupled to sacrifice the national\\r\\ntranquillity to personal advantage or personal gratification.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe celebrated Pericles, in compliance with the resentment of a\\r\\nprostitute,(1) at the expense of much of the blood and treasure of\\r\\nhis countrymen, attacked, vanquished, and destroyed the city of\\r\\nthe SAMMIANS. The same man, stimulated by private pique against the\\r\\nMEGARENSIANS,(2) another nation of Greece, or to avoid a prosecution\\r\\nwith which he was threatened as an accomplice of a supposed theft of\\r\\nthe statuary Phidias,(3) or to get rid of the accusations prepared to\\r\\nbe brought against him for dissipating the funds of the state in the\\r\\npurchase of popularity,(4) or from a combination of all these causes,\\r\\nwas the primitive author of that famous and fatal war, distinguished in\\r\\nthe Grecian annals by the name of the PELOPONNESIAN war; which, after\\r\\nvarious vicissitudes, intermissions, and renewals, terminated in the\\r\\nruin of the Athenian commonwealth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ambitious cardinal, who was prime minister to Henry VIII.,\\r\\npermitting his vanity to aspire to the triple crown,(5) entertained\\r\\nhopes of succeeding in the acquisition of that splendid prize by the\\r\\ninfluence of the Emperor Charles V. To secure the favor and interest of\\r\\nthis enterprising and powerful monarch, he precipitated England into a\\r\\nwar with France, contrary to the plainest dictates of policy, and at the\\r\\nhazard of the safety and independence, as well of the kingdom over which\\r\\nhe presided by his counsels, as of Europe in general. For if there\\r\\never was a sovereign who bid fair to realize the project of universal\\r\\nmonarchy, it was the Emperor Charles V., of whose intrigues Wolsey was\\r\\nat once the instrument and the dupe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe influence which the bigotry of one female,(6) the petulance of\\r\\nanother,(7) and the cabals of a third,(8) had in the contemporary\\r\\npolicy, ferments, and pacifications, of a considerable part of Europe,\\r\\nare topics that have been too often descanted upon not to be generally\\r\\nknown.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo multiply examples of the agency of personal considerations in\\r\\nthe production of great national events, either foreign or domestic,\\r\\naccording to their direction, would be an unnecessary waste of time.\\r\\nThose who have but a superficial acquaintance with the sources from\\r\\nwhich they are to be drawn, will themselves recollect a variety of\\r\\ninstances; and those who have a tolerable knowledge of human nature will\\r\\nnot stand in need of such lights to form their opinion either of the\\r\\nreality or extent of that agency. Perhaps, however, a reference, tending\\r\\nto illustrate the general principle, may with propriety be made to a\\r\\ncase which has lately happened among ourselves. If Shays had not been a\\r\\nDESPERATE DEBTOR, it is much to be doubted whether Massachusetts would\\r\\nhave been plunged into a civil war.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut notwithstanding the concurring testimony of experience, in this\\r\\nparticular, there are still to be found visionary or designing men,\\r\\nwho stand ready to advocate the paradox of perpetual peace between the\\r\\nStates, though dismembered and alienated from each other. The genius of\\r\\nrepublics (say they) is pacific; the spirit of commerce has a tendency\\r\\nto soften the manners of men, and to extinguish those inflammable humors\\r\\nwhich have so often kindled into wars. Commercial republics, like ours,\\r\\nwill never be disposed to waste themselves in ruinous contentions with\\r\\neach other. They will be governed by mutual interest, and will cultivate\\r\\na spirit of mutual amity and concord.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it not (we may ask these projectors in politics) the true interest of\\r\\nall nations to cultivate the same benevolent and philosophic spirit? If\\r\\nthis be their true interest, have they in fact pursued it? Has it not,\\r\\non the contrary, invariably been found that momentary passions, and\\r\\nimmediate interest, have a more active and imperious control over human\\r\\nconduct than general or remote considerations of policy, utility or\\r\\njustice? Have republics in practice been less addicted to war than\\r\\nmonarchies? Are not the former adm"
