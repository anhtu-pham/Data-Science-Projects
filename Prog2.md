# Programming Assignment 2
**Instructions:**  Only one notebook/program is needed from a group unless otherwise specified. Please make sure to write well-documented code using good variable names. Each person in each group must commit and push their own work. You will not get credit for work committed/pushed by someone else even if done by you. Each person is expected to do an approximately equal share of the work, as shown by the git logs. **If we do not see evidence of equal contribution from the logs for someone, their individual grade will be reduced substantially.** Please comment the last commit with "FINAL COMMIT" and **enter the final commit ID in canvas by the due date.**

Not all data is stored as tables. In this assignment, we will read in and analyze some text documents. Download the "federalistpapers.txt" file from Canvas. These documents are described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers. They are a collection of 85 essays written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Jay to support the adoption of the Constitution of the United States. While the authorship of most of these essays is well established, 12 of them (49-58 and 62-63) are disputed. In the file given, the authorship of these is given as James Madison which is the current consensus. We will try to verify or reject this by using data science---an algorithmic analysis of the text in these documents.

Write a Julia program "federalist.jl." Your program should do all of the following (do not do any of it manually). Remember to properly split up your code into functions as needed.
1. Read in the federalistpapers.txt file. (1 point)
2. Break it up into the individual essays. Each essay starts with "Federalist No. n." Within each essay you can skip everything up to and including "To the People of the State of New York:" and the footnotes after "PUBLIUS." You can also skip everything up to the start of the first essay and everything after the end of the last essay. (3 points)
3. Store the essays in a string array of arrays, where array\[n\]\[k\] is a string contain`ing paragraph k of Federalist No. n. In the txt files, paragraphs are separated by blank lines. As you do this, remove all newlines from within a paragraph and concatenate the lines. So the lines in the text:  
"AFTER an unequivocal experience of the inefficacy of the subsisting  
federal government, you are called upon to deliberate on a new  
Constitution for the United States of America. The subject speaks its"  
will become:  
"AFTER an unequivocal experience of the inefficacy of the subsisting federal government, you are called upon to deliberate on a new Constitution for the United States of America. The subject speaks its" and so on. (7 points)  
4. In a separate array, store the authors of each essay as given in the text. The authors are listed immediately above the "To the People of the State of New York:" string. For the essays 49-58 and 62-63, store "Unknown" as the author. (2 points)
5. Make all essays lowercase. (2 points)
6. From each essay, remove all parenthetical references to footnotes, e.g. "(1)" (2 points)
7. Remove all numbers, such as "1774." (2 points)
8. From each essay, remove all non-sentence terminating punctuation, i.e. punctuation other than !, . and ? such as commas, apostrophes, semicolons, colons, inverted commas and dashes. (3 points) 
9. Let the set of authors be Hamilton, Madison (exclude 49-58 and 62-63), Jay, Unknown (for essays 49-58 and 62-63) and All (all essays). For each author, find all essays written by them. Assign essays written by "Madison, with Hamilton" to both Madison and Hamilton. Then, for each author, do the following:
    - 9a. Find the average number of words per essay they wrote. A word is any string of characters separated by spaces. (6 points)
    - 9b. Find the average character length of all words used in an essay they wrote. (6 points)
    - 9c. Find the average number of sentences in an essay they wrote. A sentence is a string of words ending in a period, question mark or exclamation mark. (6 points)
    - 9d. Find the average number of sentences per paragraph in an essay they wrote. (5 points)
    - 9e. Find all unique words and how often they occur (their __frequency__) in the essays they wrote. (10 points) 
10. Using your answer to 9e, for each author among Madison, Hamilton and Jay, find a set of 10 words that are most frequent to them, but not as frequent for the others as follows. Let $M(w)$, $H(w)$ and $J(w)$ be the normalized frequencies of word $w$ for Madison, Hamilton and Jay (normalized means the frequency is divided by the total number of words in their essays). Define $Score_{Madison}(w)=|M(w)-H(w)|+|M(w)-J(w)|$, and similarly for Hamilton and Jay. Then find the 10 words for each of Madison, Hamilton and Jay with maximum $Score$ values. (10 points)
11. Output the answers to 9a-d to the console with appropriate descriptors. For example, "Average number of words per essay by Madison is $m, by Hamilton is $h, by Jay is $j, by unknown is $u and overall is $o." (5 points)
12. Output the answers to 10 to the console as "Top ten words for $author: $w1, $w2..." (one line for each author). (5 points)
13. Now construct a feature vector for each author (including Unknown) as follows. The first four entries are the result of 9a-d for the author. The remaining entries correspond to the 30 words from part 10, and the values for each entry is the normalized frequency for that word for the author (if the word is not used by the author, enter zero as the value). (10 points)
14. Finally, compare the feature vector for Unknown to each of Madison, Hamilton and Jay using the 2-norm. The hypothesized author is whoever's vector is closest to Unknown's. Output the result to the console as "Predicted author to Federalist Papers 49-58 and 62-63 is $author." (10 points)
15. Include a README with one or two suggestions to improve the prediction process based on your experience writing and experimenting with this code. For example, could other features have been tried? Could the $Score$ function be improved? (5 points)
16. For a bonus, implement and evaluate at least one of your suggestions and report the results separately to the console. (3 points)
